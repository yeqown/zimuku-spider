1
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:07,565
《夏日亡魂》 前情提要
Previously on "Dead of Summer"...

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,566
我要走了
I got to go.

3
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:09,567
我做错什么了 克瑞克特
What did I do? Cricket!

4
00:00:09,602 --> 00:00:10,497
你到底是谁
Who are you?

5
00:00:10,608 --> 00:00:12,061
你说过你会接受真正的我的
Look, you said you could accept me.

6
00:00:12,106 --> 00:00:13,537
-布莱尔 -每次我看到你
- Blair... - Every time I see you,

7
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:14,538
你好像都在拍摄什么东西
you seem to be filming something.

8
00:00:14,574 --> 00:00:15,773
俗话说得好
You know what they say.

9
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:16,915
摄像头从不会撒谎
The camera never lies.

10
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:18,442
我觉得我能和你聊一晚上
I feel like I could talk to you all night.

11
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:20,318
恶心 她都和你妈妈差不多大了
Gross. She's like your mother's age.

12
00:00:20,473 --> 00:00:22,405
戴伯可能对自己的身份有所隐瞒
Deb might not be who she says she is.

13
00:00:22,408 --> 00:00:24,041
戴伯不是坏人
Deb is not Satanic.

14
00:00:24,153 --> 00:00:25,583
可如果她是的话 克瑞克特不就说对了吗
If she was, isn't Cricket right?

15
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:26,717
她肯定不会说出来啊
Wouldn't she hide it?

16
00:00:26,753 --> 00:00:28,653
可我确实知道这儿不对劲
But I do know something is going on here.

17
00:00:28,688 --> 00:00:30,521
你有没有想过
You ever think it's possible...

18
00:00:30,556 --> 00:00:32,590
这些东西有可能是真的
that some of it could be real?

19
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:36,427
那个高个男人说过“这才只是刚刚开始”
The Tall Man has said, "It's only just begun."

20
00:00:43,703 --> 00:00:45,663
你希望我说点什么吗
Do you expect me to talk?

21
00:00:45,672 --> 00:00:46,637
不用 邦德先生
No, Mr. Bond.

22
00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:47,638
我只希望你英勇牺牲
I expect you to die.

23
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:50,708
看看这个 乔尔
Oh, check it out, Joel!

24
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:55,579
你觉得我能在舞会上扮成007吗
Do you think I could pass as 007 at prom?

25
00:00:55,615 --> 00:00:56,627
也许吧
Maybe...

26
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,416
如果大家都瞎了眼的话
If everyone there was blind.

27
00:00:58,451 --> 00:00:59,517
好咯
Oh, okay.

28
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:04,328
我会想念你的 弟弟
You know, I'm gonna miss you, bro.

29
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:05,723
再过几周 你就得去夏令营里了 伙计
A few more weeks, you'll be off at camp, man.

30
00:01:05,758 --> 00:01:07,518
我希望你能和我一起去
I wish you could come with me.

31
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:09,760
不了 我已经在清水市有过自己的回忆了
Nah, I've had my own experience with Stillwater.

32
00:01:09,796 --> 00:01:11,629
你需要去亲自体验一下
You got to experience it for yourself.

33
00:01:11,664 --> 00:01:14,565
在那当一个讨人厌的孩子吗 没人会相信我和你是亲兄弟的
As the geeky kid that nobody can believe is related to you?

34
00:01:18,604 --> 00:01:21,539
你穿着这个 看他们还会不会叫你讨厌鬼
Let's see them call you geeky in that.

35
00:01:21,574 --> 00:01:24,475
这都能装下四个我了
I could fit four of me in this.

36
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,810
这就要看你怎么穿了
It depends how you wear it.

37
00:01:25,845 --> 00:01:27,745
人们的感觉总能打败现实
Perception beats reality every time.

38
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,650
我不敢相信你要送我你最喜欢的衣服
I can't believe you're giving me your favorite shirt.

39
00:01:32,685 --> 00:01:34,785
等你赢了奥斯卡再来感谢我吧 好吗
Just thank me when you win your first Oscar, okay?

40
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:35,786
成交
Deal.

41
00:01:35,822 --> 00:01:37,722
这才是我弟弟
My man.

42
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:50,368
迈克尔 怎么了
What's wrong, Michael?

43
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:51,802
你是不是 看到什么了
Did you... see something?

44
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:54,839
我 我看到一个小家伙 他害得我参加舞会快要迟到啦
Uh, I-I see a kid who's gonna make me late for prom, man.

45
00:01:54,874 --> 00:01:56,674
走吧 我得赶紧收拾好自己 小家伙
Come on, I got to get out of here, punk.

46
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:57,808
我得去冲个澡 然后在豪华轿车到这之前
I got to get showered and get this tux on

47
00:01:57,844 --> 00:01:59,677
穿好礼服
before the limo gets here.

48
00:02:13,426 --> 00:02:14,725
别这样嘛 大家
Come on, guys.

49
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:16,327
还有半个小时我们就得出发了
We're supposed to hit the trail in a half hour.

50
00:02:16,362 --> 00:02:17,628
-你们这是干什么 -除非我们得到想要的答案
- What are you doing? - We're not going anywhere

51
00:02:17,663 --> 00:02:18,663
不然我们是不会离开的
till we get some answers.

52
00:02:18,664 --> 00:02:19,630
什么答案
About what?

53
00:02:19,665 --> 00:02:20,698
昨晚
Last night.

54
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:22,600
是啊 你和戴伯昨晚消失去哪儿了
Yeah, where'd you and Deb disappear to?

55
00:02:22,635 --> 00:02:23,701
你们是认真的吗
Seriously?

56
00:02:23,736 --> 00:02:25,636
她 有带着那吓人的面具吗
She, uh, bring that creepy mask with her?

57
00:02:25,671 --> 00:02:27,471
我们一直很担心你
We were worried about you.

58
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:28,506
只是我们中的某些人
Some of us.

59
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,809
那面具根本不是她的
That mask isn't even hers.

60
00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:32,416
行了 你们都误会戴伯了
Okay, you guys have the wrong idea about Deb.

61
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:35,479
哟 伙计 你和她打了一炮啊
Yo, man. You totally banged her!

62
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:36,781
你说什么
What?

63
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:38,682
不 我才没有
No, I didn't.

64
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:39,717

而且我知道你都录在摄影机里了
And I know you got it on that camera.

66
00:02:41,788 --> 00:02:42,820
来嘛 让我看看
Come on, let me check it out.

67
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:44,722
来嘛 让我就看一眼
Come on, let me check it out.

68
00:02:44,757 --> 00:02:46,597
-你们都疯啦 -得了吧 乔尔
- You guys are crazy! - Come on, Joel!

69
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:48,692
你才是那个和大了你两倍岁数的人滚床单的家伙
You're the one who had sex with someone twice your age.

70
00:02:48,728 --> 00:02:50,628
我们想听细节 快说
We want details... now.

71
00:02:50,663 --> 00:02:54,432
这个嘛 你和德鲁在化妆舞会上动了真感情诶
Well, you and Drew got pretty serious at the masquerade.

72
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:56,534
你为什么不给我们讲讲细节
Why don't you give us some of those details?

73
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:57,535
关于这一点
And on that note...

74
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,537
-好吧 -对
- Yeah. - Yeah.

75
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:01,012
-闪人 -闪人
- Yeah. - Yeah.

76
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:07,906


77
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:22,867
好啦 大家快点
All right, come on!

78
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,362
我们要在高处草地上野营啦
We're gonna make camp at High Meadow!

79
00:03:25,398 --> 00:03:27,518
我们要扎好帐篷 还要煮晚饭
We're gonna pitch our tents and then cook dinner.

80
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:30,534
你们在那里能看到天上的每一颗星星
You guys will get to see every star in the sky from up there,

81
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,336
今晚还有血月出现
and there's a Blood Moon tonight,

82
00:03:32,371 --> 00:03:34,405
所以会特别壮观的
so it'll be extra awesome.

83
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,539
大家都跟紧克瑞克特
Everyone follow Cricket's lead.

84
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:38,342
她是我们的户外野营专家
She is our resident outdoor specialist.

85
00:03:38,377 --> 00:03:40,377
选个小伙伴 待在团队里
Pick a partner, stay in groups,

86
00:03:40,413 --> 00:03:42,379
千万不要走散了
and don't wander off the path!

87
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:44,815
这森林里到处都藏着捕熊陷阱
There are bear traps hidden everywhere in these woods.

88
00:03:48,454 --> 00:03:50,454
你真的很喜欢她 对吗
You really like her, huh?

89
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:55,526
关于昨晚的疑惑 我很抱歉
I'm sorry about the confusion last night.

90
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:57,361
如果我们早知道
If we had known...

91
00:03:57,396 --> 00:03:58,829
没事的 不用担心
Yeah, don't worry about it.

92
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:00,364
我知道这跟我没什么关系
I know it's none of my business,

93
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:02,766
不过我觉得你们两个 挺棒的
but I think it's great... you two.

94
00:04:02,802 --> 00:04:04,401
谁在意别人怎么说
Who cares what they say?

95
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:07,371
能和一个人产生共鸣实属不易
It's not easy to make a connection with someone.

96
00:04:07,406 --> 00:04:09,440
如果你这么幸运地找到了
If you're lucky enough to find it,

97
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:11,408
你就应该努力争取 对吧
you should go for it, right?

98
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:14,445
对
Right.

99
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,779
嗷呜
Boo!

100
00:04:18,484 --> 00:04:20,384
嘿 嘿 发生什么了
Hey, hey, what's going on?

101
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:22,419
阿莱克斯说树林里有一只怪物
Alex said there's a monster in these woods!

102
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:24,388
是的 一只吃人肉的食尸鬼
Yeah, a flesh-eating ghoul

103
00:04:24,423 --> 00:04:28,325
它最喜欢喝野营的人的血了
with a taste for camper blood.

104
00:04:29,495 --> 00:04:30,495
我们走吧
Let's go.

105
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,396
就玩玩嘛 杰西
Whatever, Jessie.

106
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:34,398
-别这样嘛 -拜 阿莱克斯
-Come on. -Bye, Alex.

107
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,404
嘿 你还好吗
Hey, are you okay?

108
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,805
我不能呼吸了
I can't breathe.

109
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:44,441
我想她需要她的吸入器 就在她背包最上面的袋子里
I think she needs her inhaler. It's in the top of her bag.

110
00:04:44,477 --> 00:04:45,509
好的 我拿到了
All right, I got it.

111
00:04:45,545 --> 00:04:47,444
没事的 放轻松
It's gonna be okay, just relax.

112
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,815
就是这样
There you go.

113
00:04:53,553 --> 00:04:55,519
感觉好些了吗
Better?

114
00:04:55,555 --> 00:04:58,489
别担心 弗朗茜 这只是个故事
Don't worry, Francie. It's just a story.

115
00:04:58,524 --> 00:05:00,357
森林里没有怪物要伤害你
Nothing in these woods will hurt you.

116
00:05:00,393 --> 00:05:01,392
我跟你保证
I promise.

117
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:03,327
好吧
Okay.

118
00:05:03,362 --> 00:05:04,461
那行 和杰西一起走吧
All right, go with Jessie.

119
00:05:04,497 --> 00:05:05,763
没事的
It's okay.

120
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:12,303
艾米
Amy.

121
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:25,516
快给我走开
Leave me alone.

122
00:05:38,397 --> 00:05:39,477
你还好吗
Are you okay?

123
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:45,803
你是不是看到什么了
Did you see something?

124
00:05:45,838 --> 00:05:48,339
没有
Nope.

125
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:51,508
我挺好的
I'm good.

126
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,447
可以了 说茄子
Okay, say cheese.

127
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,350
笑一个
Smile.

128
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:02,453
你哥哥怎么这么久还没好
What is taking your brother so long?

129
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:04,355
车子已经在等了
Limo's waiting.

130
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:07,324
我去叫他
I'll go get him.

131
00:06:09,428 --> 00:06:10,461
迈克尔
Michael?

132
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:11,495
迈克尔
Michael?

133
00:06:20,406 --> 00:06:21,405
迈克尔
Michael?!

134
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:53,034


135
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:58,310
好 阿莱克斯和克瑞克特 你们负责柴火

136
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:00,345
德鲁和布莱尔 你们去安排食物
Drew and Blair, get the food organized.

137
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,615
艾米和杰西 我们需要从小溪里取点水来
Amy and Jessie, we need water from the stream.

138
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,217

And, Joel, you'll stay back with me

139
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:06,284
帮我把帐篷都搭好
and help me pitch the tents.

140
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,187
嘿 祝你搭戴伯的小帐篷搭得愉快
Hey, have fun pitching Deb's tent.

141
00:07:09,223 --> 00:07:10,522
你知道我会的
You know I will.

142
00:07:10,557 --> 00:07:11,623
喔
Oh.

143
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:14,459
艾米
Amy.

144
00:07:14,494 --> 00:07:15,627
怎么了
Yeah?

145
00:07:15,662 --> 00:07:19,364
小心点
Um, be careful out there.

146
00:07:32,646 --> 00:07:35,180
真有必要看这个吗
Is that really necessary?

147
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:37,515
我在员工休息室里找到的
I found it in the staff lounge.

148
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:39,184
我想应该能派上用场
I figured it could come in handy,

149
00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:41,586
毕竟是我第一次在森林里过夜
being my first overnight and all.

150
00:07:44,391 --> 00:07:47,292
嘿 乔尔还好吗
Hey, is everything okay with Joel?

151
00:07:47,327 --> 00:07:50,228
他看起来有点恍惚
He seemed kind of off.

152
00:07:50,264 --> 00:07:52,230
也许是因为他不像加勒特一样那么疯狂地迷恋你
Maybe he's just not as taken with you as Garrett.

153
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:53,598
你说什么
Excuse me?

154
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:57,266
昨晚我看到你的舌头都要伸进他喉咙里了
I saw you last night with your tongue down his throat.

155
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,406
-我听不懂你在说什么 -艾米 别装了好吗
- I am so confused. - Amy, just stop, okay?

156
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:02,507
我看到你们接吻了
I saw you guys kissing.

157
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:05,343
可我根本不记得跟他亲过啊
I don't remember kissing him at all.

158
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:07,445
最近这里发生了特别多诡异的事情
So many freaky things have been going on here.

159
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:08,446
是这个地方的原因
It's this place.

160
00:08:08,482 --> 00:08:10,348
不 是你自己的问题 别再遮遮掩掩装白莲了
No, it's you. Stop putting up a front.

161
00:08:10,384 --> 00:08:12,184
如果你喜欢他的话 直说就好了
If you're into him, just say so.

162
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:13,318
如果你喜欢他的话 你就说啊
If you're into him, you say so.

163
00:08:13,353 --> 00:08:14,619
你在瞎说什么啊
What are you talking about?

164
00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:17,222
这里遮遮掩掩的人就只有你一个
The only one putting up a front here is you.

165
00:08:17,257 --> 00:08:18,623
而且加勒特不是你所有老朋友中唯一一个
And Garrett's not the only one of your old friends

166
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:20,191
不喜欢你这样装白莲的
who doesn't like it.

167
00:08:30,437 --> 00:08:31,503
乔尔
Joel.

168
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:34,272
你能把那摄像机放下一会么
Can you put the camera down for a second?

169
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:35,273
我需要
I could, um...

170
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,408
我需要你帮我一下
I could use a hand.

171
00:08:36,443 --> 00:08:40,211
我 我不能把这钉子钉牢在地里
I, uh... I can't get the stake to stay in the ground.

172
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:42,881
好的 好的 我这就来
Yeah, yeah. One second.

173
00:08:45,686 --> 00:08:47,485
我来吧
Allow me.

174
00:08:52,592 --> 00:08:53,591
弄好了
There you go.

175
00:08:53,627 --> 00:08:55,507
再也没有东西能把这钉子给弄出来了
Nothing is knocking this thing down.

176
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:58,396
除非是《激流四勇士》的演员决定现身搞破坏
Unless the cast of "Deliverance" Decides to show up.

177
00:08:58,432 --> 00:09:02,267
每次我去野营我都会想起这部电影
I think about that movie every time I go camping.

178
00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:03,301
谁不是呢
How can you not?

179
00:09:04,404 --> 00:09:06,604
想进帐篷里试一下吗
Want to test it out from the inside,

180
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,173
看看这个帐篷是不是特牢固
make sure it's extra sturdy?

181
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,141
唔
Um...

182
00:09:10,644 --> 00:09:12,444
你说什么
What?

183
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:13,578
我想说 要超越昨晚是有点难
I mean, it'd be hard to top last night,

184
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:15,280
不过我确信我们能再努力试试看
but I'm sure we could try.

185
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:16,975
你是说化妆舞会吗
You mean the masquerade?

186
00:09:19,553 --> 00:09:21,386
你真有趣
You're funny.

187
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:23,221
好啦 我知道了
Yeah, I get it.

188
00:09:23,256 --> 00:09:24,289
这时间和地点确实都不太合适
It's not the time or the place.

189
00:09:24,324 --> 00:09:25,323
也许再晚点吧
Maybe later.

190
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:27,192
你还好吗 乔尔
You all right, Joel?

191
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:29,661
我很好啊
Yeah.

192
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:33,264
只是当你和某个人产生如此强烈的共鸣时
It's just that when you really make a connection with somebody,

193
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,566
那感觉真的很美妙
it's pretty great.

194
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:36,534
谢谢你 你真贴心
That's sweet. Thank you.

195
00:09:39,506 --> 00:09:43,341
绝对不要把这身衣服弄皱了
No way I'm doing ruffles.

196
00:09:43,377 --> 00:09:45,457
嘿 别拍我 肯尼 我看起来就像
Hey, don't film this, Kenny. I look like a...

197
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:46,511
大块头吗
A hunk?

198
00:09:46,546 --> 00:09:48,279
你是想说呆瓜吗
You mean dork?

199
00:09:48,315 --> 00:09:49,414
嘿
Hey.

200
00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:51,383
别理他 你一点都不像傻瓜 宝贝
Come on, there's nothing dorky about you, babe.

201
00:09:51,418 --> 00:09:53,251
你看起来像007
You look like Bond.

202
00:09:53,286 --> 00:09:55,253
是吗 哪个 是康纳利还是摩尔演的
Yeah? Which one... Connery or Moore?

203
00:09:55,288 --> 00:09:56,654
拉森比演的
Mm, Lazenby.

204
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,323
啊你真是
Ow! You just...

205
00:09:58,358 --> 00:10:00,625
好了啦 你比其他男的帅多了
Come on, you're a million times hotter than all those guys,

206
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,660
你知道的 我钱途无量的宝贝儿
and you know it, Mr. Golden Boy,

207
00:10:02,696 --> 00:10:06,498
你都被纽约大学电影学院提前录取了
early acceptance to NYU Film School.

208
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:08,466
你最好让我参演你的所有电影
You better put me in all your movies.

209
00:10:08,502 --> 00:10:09,534
-你还不知道吗 -什么
- Oh, you didn't know? - Hmm?

210
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:11,369
你已经是我其中一部电影的主演了
You're already in one of my movies.

211
00:10:11,405 --> 00:10:13,485
名字叫《试衣间》
It's called "The Fitting Room."

212
00:10:13,507 --> 00:10:15,373
-别 -来嘛 看镜头
- Stop! - Come on, come on.

213
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:16,441
你要是想演我的电影 就不能那么害羞
You can't be shy if you're gonna be in my movies.

214
00:10:16,476 --> 00:10:19,277
不不 放下摄像机 乔尔
No, no, put it down. Joel!

215
00:10:19,312 --> 00:10:20,378
好吧 好吧
All right, all right.

216
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:30,689
乔尔
Joel?

217
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,657
你怎么了
What are you doing?

218
00:10:35,562 --> 00:10:36,494
没什么
Nothing.

219
00:10:38,465 --> 00:10:41,399
你不打算帮我一下吗
Are you gonna help me at all?

220
00:10:41,435 --> 00:10:45,236
我也想 但是
I would love to, but, uh...

221
00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:46,404
这根怎么样
How's this one?

222
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,339
不怎么样
No, not that one.

223
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,707
太脆了吗
Too flimsy?

224
00:10:49,743 --> 00:10:53,311
太嫩了 点燃会冒烟 但是不会燃烧
Too green. It'll smoke, not burn.

225
00:10:53,346 --> 00:10:56,581
你还真的是夜场女王啊
You really are still queen of the overnight, aren't you?

226
00:10:56,616 --> 00:10:58,249
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

227
00:10:58,285 --> 00:11:00,552
嘿 记得我们以前叫你戴维・克瑞克特吗
Hey, remember when we used to call you Davy Cricket?

228
00:11:00,587 --> 00:11:02,467
嗯 我记得你是那么叫我的
Yeah, I remember you calling me that

229
00:11:02,489 --> 00:11:03,488
而我很讨厌这个名字
and me hating it.

230
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:06,391
得了吧 你挺喜欢的
Oh, come on, you liked it.

231
00:11:06,426 --> 00:11:08,293
你就承认吧
Come on, admit it.

232
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:10,428
你小心点
What are you doing?

233
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,266
我告诉过你了 这东西到处都是
I told you, they're everywhere.

234
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:19,571
哇
Whoa.

235
00:11:19,606 --> 00:11:22,507
这不好笑 你应该当心点儿
Not funny. You should keep your eyes open.

236
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:23,541
我们都得小心点
We all should.

237
00:11:23,577 --> 00:11:24,642
为什么
And why is that?

238
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:26,544
因为这些捕熊陷阱不只是唯一
Because bear traps aren't the only thing

239
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,480
我们要担心的东西
we should be worried about.

240
00:11:28,515 --> 00:11:29,481
即使不是戴伯
Even if it wasn't Deb,

241
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:31,349
我还是看到有人戴着那个面具
I still saw someone in that mask.

242
00:11:31,384 --> 00:11:33,284
这不是我想象出来的
I didn't imagine it,

243
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,160
而且他们有可能还在这里
and they could still be out there.

244
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:38,223
你知道吗 看起来
You know, it seems like...

245
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:42,694
你需要点别的事情来转移你的注意力
you need something else to focus on.

246
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:44,562
是吗
Oh, yeah?

247
00:11:44,598 --> 00:11:45,663
是的
Yeah.

248
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:48,466
我在想 今晚熄灯后
You know, I was thinking, maybe I'd come here tonight,

249
00:11:48,502 --> 00:11:51,458
也许我会来这里 来看血月
after lights out, and watch the Blood Moon.

250
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:54,405
你想一起吗
You want to join?

251
00:11:54,441 --> 00:11:57,375
你的意思是问我想不想和你在血月下做爱吗
You mean, do I want to have sex with you under the Blood Moon?

252
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,377
我可没那么说
I did not say that.

253
00:11:59,412 --> 00:12:00,645
我知道你是什么样的人
I know you.

254
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,181
也许我变了呢 克瑞克特
Maybe I've changed, Cricket.

255
00:12:03,216 --> 00:12:06,551
又或者也许我是第一个拒绝你的女孩呢
Or maybe I'm the first girl that's ever turned you down,

256
00:12:06,586 --> 00:12:08,540
而你无法接受这个事实
and you can't handle it.

257
00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:11,523
好好欣赏血月吧
Enjoy the Blood Moon.

258
00:12:13,593 --> 00:12:16,427
“选对正确的木棍是
"The right stick is essential

259
00:12:16,463 --> 00:12:19,364
烤出优质棉花糖的关键”
to the perfectly roasted marshmallow."

260
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,365
我有一根
I've got one.

261
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,432
真棒
Nice!

262
00:12:22,469 --> 00:12:23,434
来 我们交换一下吧
Here, let's switch.

263
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,469
看着点儿 兄弟
Watch out, buddy.

264
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:26,437
抱歉
Oh, sorry about that.

265
00:12:26,473 --> 00:12:28,239
没关系
That's okay.

266
00:12:29,242 --> 00:12:30,275
毕业舞会照的吗
Prom date?

267
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,242
嘿
Hey.

268
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:33,311
你们看上去好开心
You guys look happy.

269
00:12:33,346 --> 00:12:34,579
是啊
We were.

270
00:12:34,614 --> 00:12:35,647
还在看书吗
Studying up?

271
00:12:35,682 --> 00:12:37,582
多知道点总不会有错 对吧
Couldn't hurt, right?

272
00:12:37,617 --> 00:12:41,419
再说了 你之前好像很担心我
Plus, you did seem worried about me earlier.

273
00:12:41,454 --> 00:12:43,354
是的 抱歉
Yeah, sorry.

274
00:12:44,558 --> 00:12:46,424
我可能有点想多了
Guess I was a little paranoid.

275
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:48,293
那你现在没事了吧
You're good now, though?

276
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:49,663
是的
Yeah.

277
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:55,633
好了 让我看看 你烤得怎么样
Okay, let's see. How you doing?

278
00:13:17,357 --> 00:13:21,192
今晚 杀了 艾米
Kill... Amy... tonight.

279
00:13:21,227 --> 00:13:24,529
不然其他人就会死
Or someone else will die.

280
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:47,766
布莱尔
Blair.

281
00:13:47,802 --> 00:13:49,324
克瑞克特最喜欢的歌是什么
What's Cricket's favorite song?

282
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:50,402
为什么这么问
Why?

283
00:13:50,437 --> 00:13:51,670
问这么多干嘛
What do you care why?

284
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:54,673
是不是当直男被女孩拒绝了
Is this that thing that straight guys do

285
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,741
就会这么做啊
when girls reject them?

286
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:58,544
快 最喜欢的歌 很简单的问题

Yeah, I know.

289
00:14:01,615 --> 00:14:04,616
我希望也许他忘记了某一首歌
I was hoping maybe he'd forgotten a track.

290
00:14:04,652 --> 00:14:06,418

He did, actually.

291
00:14:06,453 --> 00:14:08,185
《迷人的月亮》 回声与兔人乐队的

还有 不要再叫我德鲁斯基了
Also, never call me Drewski again,

298
00:14:17,865 --> 00:14:19,631
不然我就杀了你
or I will end your life.

299
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:21,733
好吧
Fair enough.

300
00:14:25,606 --> 00:14:28,574
你刚刚还真是酷
That was really cool of you.

301
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:31,443
听着 我很理解你为什么生我气
Look, I don't blame you for being mad at me.

302
00:14:31,478 --> 00:14:32,477
我只是想说
I just wanted to say...

303
00:14:32,513 --> 00:14:34,446
我给过你机会了
Okay, you had your chance.

304
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:36,849
再给多我次机会吧
Well, I'm asking for another one.

305
00:14:36,884 --> 00:14:39,785
你告诉我你是谁
You showed me who you are.

306
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,588
我告诉你我是谁 还有什么好说的
I showed you who I was. What's left to say?

307
00:14:47,695 --> 00:14:50,462
天啊
Oh, God!

308
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:52,531
有人忘了在里面放冰块了
Someone forgot to put ice in there.

309
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:55,400
恶
Ugh.

310
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,468
好了 没关系
Okay. It's okay.

311
00:14:56,503 --> 00:14:58,437
我们还有一些热狗 在营地那边
Um, there's hot dogs, uh, down at the camp.

312
00:14:58,472 --> 00:14:59,552

329
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:30,802
这是你的选择
It's your choice.

330
00:15:33,841 --> 00:15:35,574
她不死
Her...

331
00:15:36,744 --> 00:15:41,446
其他人就会死
or someone else will die.

332
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,547

339
00:16:30,731 --> 00:16:32,497
你在哪里
Where are you?

340
00:16:36,603 --> 00:16:38,664
我要把这个给警察看
I'm showing this to the cops!

341
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,784
嘿

342
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,619

343
00:16:54,655 --> 00:16:56,555
我 我听到你在大叫
I, uh... I heard you yelling.

344
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,657
是的 我只是
Yeah, uh, I was just...

345
00:16:58,692 --> 00:17:00,652
这个东西 我系不好
this thing is... I can't figure it out.

346
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:03,562
我有点儿崩溃
I got frustrated.

347
00:17:03,597 --> 00:17:07,432
所以我想着出来外面呼吸一下新鲜空气
I figured I'd just come outside and get some fresh air.

348
00:17:07,468 --> 00:17:09,668
来 我帮你系好
Here, let me help you out.

349
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:13,672
你得慢慢开始习惯穿礼服了
Now, you better get used to wearing a tux.

350
00:17:13,707 --> 00:17:16,708
今晚参加毕业舞会 明天就去艾美奖颁奖礼
Tonight the prom, tomorrow the Emmys.

351
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:20,579

谢谢你爸爸
Thanks, Dad.

355
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,356
你紧张吗
Are you nervous?

356
00:17:31,392 --> 00:17:32,624
紧张今晚吗
About tonight?

357
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:38,630
我只是在想迈克尔
I'm just thinking about Michael.

358
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:40,499
在毕业舞会那晚
Prom night.

359
00:17:40,534 --> 00:17:43,502
他有告诉过你他看到什么了吗
Did he ever tell you what he saw?

360
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:45,370
没有 从没说过
No, he never would.

361
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:48,507
我们不知道他看到什么了
We didn't know what he was seeing

362
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:51,777
或者说为什么他那么害怕
or why he was so... so scared of it.

363
00:17:51,812 --> 00:17:54,413
我和他
Me and him.

364
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,535
我是说 那没什么的对吧
I mean, it doesn't matter, does it?

365
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,397
无论他看到什么了 那都不是真的
Whatever he saw, it wasn't real.

366
00:18:00,654 --> 00:18:02,339
只是他自己想多了
Just a sickness in his mind.

367
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:03,555
感谢上帝
I thank God

368
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,525
你永远 都不用去面对那个噩梦
that you will never... never have to face that nightmare.

369
00:18:09,396 --> 00:18:11,396
你确定你还好吗
Are you sure you're okay?

370
00:18:11,432 --> 00:18:13,398
你知道 无论发生什么了
You know, whatever it is,

371
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:16,334
你都可以告诉我 好吗
you know you can tell me, right?

372
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,738
可能我是有点儿紧张
Maybe I'm a little nervous.

373
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:23,542
不想让劳拉失望
Don't want to disappoint Laura.

374
00:18:24,578 --> 00:18:26,179
你不会的
You won't.

375
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,420

377
00:18:37,524 --> 00:18:40,392
嗯 孩子们都好
Yeah, kids are okay.

378
00:18:40,427 --> 00:18:43,728
唔
Um...

379
00:18:43,764 --> 00:18:45,664
但是我不好
But I'm not.

380
00:18:45,699 --> 00:18:48,733
我有预感有些事情要发生
I had a feeling something was up.

381
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:49,768
怎么回事
What is it?

382
00:18:49,803 --> 00:18:53,538
我以前从没告诉过任何人
I've never told anyone this before.

383
00:18:57,478 --> 00:18:58,510
没关系
It's all right. Yeah.

384
00:18:58,545 --> 00:19:00,412
我觉得我和你心有灵犀
I feel like I have a connection with you.

385
00:19:00,447 --> 00:19:01,446
是的
Yeah.

386
00:19:04,451 --> 00:19:05,450
嘿
Hey.

387
00:19:05,486 --> 00:19:07,686
你在干什么
What are you doing?

388
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:08,753
我以为
I thought...

389
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:09,754
你以为什么
You thought what?

390
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,625
我想帮助你 乔尔 我真的想
I want to help, Joel, I do,

391
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,628
但是我 我仍然是你的上司
um, but I'm... I'm still your boss.

392
00:19:18,632 --> 00:19:20,565
你在说什么呢 你仍然是我的上司吗
What are you talking about, you're still my boss?

393
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:21,633
那昨晚的事算什么
What about last night?

394
00:19:21,668 --> 00:19:23,568
你不能装作什么都没有发生过一样
You can't just act like that didn't happen.

395
00:19:23,604 --> 00:19:26,404
装作没发生过什么呢
Act like what didn't happen?

396
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,807
我们去散步了 我告诉了你基思的事情
We went for a walk. I told you about Keith.

397
00:19:28,842 --> 00:19:31,376
仅此而已
That's... it.

398
00:19:33,847 --> 00:19:35,680
呃
Um...

399
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,782
不如你告诉我到底发生什么了
Why don't you tell me what's really going on.

400
00:19:37,818 --> 00:19:42,521
我想 只是
Um, I... I... I guess I just...

401
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,622
我想太多了
I read more into it.

402
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:44,623
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

403
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:45,624

It's okay.

404
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:47,492
我要走了
Uh, I'm gonna go.

405
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:44,583
你没法让我消失
You can't make me go away.

406
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:49,357
我不会消失 除非你杀掉艾米
Not here, not until you kill Amy.

407
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,900
记住 你才是说了算的 好吗
Remember, you're the boss, okay?

408
00:21:00,935 --> 00:21:02,935
别让小小的棉花糖赢过你
Don't let the marshmallow win.

409
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,640
你应该去
You should go.

410
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:09,575
去赴他的血月之约吗
To his Blood Moon rendezvous?

411
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,650
不了谢谢
No, thanks.

412
00:21:10,678 --> 00:21:11,744
我觉得他已经变了
I think he's changed.

413
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:13,045
拜托
Please.

414
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,613
他就是个辣鸡 你是知道的
He's a dirt bag, and you know it.

415
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,495
如果他只想和你上床的话
If all he wanted was to sleep with you,

416
00:21:16,644 --> 00:21:18,951
为什么他还来问我你最喜欢的歌是什么呢
why would he ask me what your favorite song is?

417
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,920
他问你我最喜欢的歌了吗
He asked you my favorite song?

418
00:21:20,955 --> 00:21:21,921
是啊
Yeah.

419
00:21:21,956 --> 00:21:23,823
他是真的很用心
He's putting himself out there.

420
00:21:23,858 --> 00:21:26,692
给他个机会吧
Just give him the chance.

421
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,702
你快没时间了
You're running out of time.

422
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:43,075
别这么做
Don't do that.

423
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,044
你会受伤的
You could hurt yourself.

424
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,119
乔尔
Joel.

425
00:21:47,048 --> 00:21:50,783
杀掉艾米
Kill Amy.

426
00:21:50,818 --> 00:21:54,720
她不死 别人就得死
Her, or someone else will die.

427
00:21:54,755 --> 00:21:56,789
是谁会死呢
Who will it be?

428
00:21:56,824 --> 00:21:59,625
你快没时间了
You're running out of time.

429
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,028
是谁会死呢
Who's it gonna be?

430
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,870
乔尔
Joel?

431
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:19,678
你的相机呢
Where's your camera?

432
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,647
你平时都一直拿着它的呀
It's usually attached to your hand.

433
00:22:21,682 --> 00:22:22,842
相机没用了
It's not working.

434
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,717
坏了吗
Is it broken?

435
00:22:24,752 --> 00:22:26,051
相机在这里没用
It doesn't work here.

436
00:22:28,656 --> 00:22:29,622
-啊 -啊
- Ah. - Ah.

437
00:22:29,657 --> 00:22:30,697
刚刚那张照得好
That was a good one.

438
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,658
我眼睛闭上了 我想重新再照一张
My eyes were closed. I want a do-over.

439
00:22:32,693 --> 00:22:34,660
你看起来美极了 宝贝
You looked gorgeous, babe.

440
00:22:34,695 --> 00:22:35,975
来嘛
Come on.

441
00:22:40,034 --> 00:22:41,800
等下 你还带着相机啊
Wait, you're bringing that?

442
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,770
是啊 今晚可是我们的毕业舞会
Yeah, it's... it's our prom night.

443
00:22:44,805 --> 00:22:45,871
你不想永远记住今晚吗
Don't you want to remember this forever?

444
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:47,840
今晚是关于我们的 关于我们的回忆
Tonight's about us, our memories.

445
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,342
这并不需要相机
You don't need a camera for that.

446
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,677
嘿 劳拉 过来
Hey, Laura, come here.

447
00:22:51,712 --> 00:22:52,745
好的
Okay.

448
00:23:03,024 --> 00:23:05,958
你不是真的
You're not real.

449
00:23:07,061 --> 00:23:09,795
你不是真的
You're not real.

450
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:15,668
你不是真的
You're not real.

451
00:23:15,703 --> 00:23:17,636
你在和谁说话
Who are you talking to?

452
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,041
没人
No one.

453
00:23:22,076 --> 00:23:24,009
呃
Uh...

454
00:23:24,045 --> 00:23:26,011
好了 你说得对 我马上回来
All right, you're right. I'll be right back.

455
00:23:26,047 --> 00:23:27,807
我去把相机存起来
I'm just gonna go check this.

456
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:29,656
嘿 玩得怎么样
Hey, how's it going?

457
00:23:29,684 --> 00:23:30,916
给你
Here you go.

458
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:31,984
是的 我能帮你暂存相机
Yeah, I can take that for you.

459
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,852
谢了
Thanks.

460
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,790
我们还在等什么啊
What are we waiting for, huh?

461
00:23:37,825 --> 00:23:38,958
你准备好跳舞了吗
Oh, you ready to dance, or what?

462
00:23:38,993 --> 00:23:40,726
过来
Get over here.

463
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:41,727
开始吧
Huh?

464
00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:49,735
给布莱尔一个机会吧
I mean, cut Blair some slack.

465
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,070
他 他 他抛弃了我
He... he's... He ran out on me.

466
00:23:51,105 --> 00:23:53,672
那又怎么样 现在他想要跟你和好了
So? Now he wants to un-run.

467
00:23:53,741 --> 00:23:56,609
你完全不知道对一个人那么坦白是什么感觉
You have no idea what it's like to be that open with someone.

468
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:57,876
你甚至都不敢告诉赛克斯
You can't even tell Sykes

469
00:23:57,912 --> 00:23:58,978
你要上法庭的事
about your court date.

470
00:24:01,882 --> 00:24:03,749
我就是说说而已
Just saying.

471
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:06,752
那是什么
What's that?

472
00:24:06,787 --> 00:24:10,723
我觉得那应该就是阿莱克斯和艾米约会的小屋
I think that's the cabin that Alex took Amy on their date.

473
00:24:10,758 --> 00:24:11,724
有情调
Hot.

474
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:18,931
你在这儿干什么呢
What are you doing here?

475
00:24:18,966 --> 00:24:20,566
我在巡逻
I'm patrolling camp

476
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:21,967
大家都应该去树林里过夜了啊
while everyone else is supposed to be on the overnight,

477
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:23,645
你们怎么没和他们一起
so why aren't you with them?

478
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:24,737
我们本来是一起的
We were.

479
00:24:24,772 --> 00:24:25,771
我们
We

480
00:24:25,806 --> 00:24:26,905
我们是和他们一起
We are. Hmm.

481
00:24:26,941 --> 00:24:29,642
好了 我来背这个
Okay. Um, I'm gonna take this.

482
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,677
你知道该怎么回去的对吧
You know how to get back, right?

483
00:24:31,712 --> 00:24:33,679
-是的 -很好
- Yeah. - Great.

484
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,918
你怎么想到要来这里
So, what brings you out here?

485
00:24:39,954 --> 00:24:42,021
我要进去
Going in there.

486
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:46,925
你想有个人陪吗
Do you want some company?

487
00:24:46,961 --> 00:24:48,794
好啊
Sure.

488
00:25:03,644 --> 00:25:04,943
这是什么地方
What is this place?

489
00:25:06,013 --> 00:25:08,547
就是个旧的猎房
It's just an old hunting cabin.

490
00:25:08,582 --> 00:25:09,948
你真不会撒谎
You're a terrible liar.

491
00:25:10,017 --> 00:25:11,817
这是我进行的调查中的一部分
It's part of an investigation I'm conducting.

492
00:25:11,852 --> 00:25:12,885
什么调查
Into what?

493
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,853
你知道清水曾经是个招魂者营地吗
Did you know Stillwater was a Spiritualist camp?

494
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:18,657
噢 就像艾米说的那些邪教徒吗
Oh, like those cultists Amy was talking about?

495
00:25:18,693 --> 00:25:19,758
她告诉你了
She told you?

496
00:25:19,794 --> 00:25:22,561
这不是什么秘密吧
I didn't realize it was a secret.

497
00:25:22,596 --> 00:25:24,276
你干嘛这么小心翼翼的
Why are you being so cagey?

498
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:30,569
1871年的时候这个小屋被突袭了
There was a raid on this cabin in 1871.

499
00:25:30,604 --> 00:25:32,838
这些人追随着一个叫做霍利尤克的招魂者首领
They were after a Spiritualist leader named Holyoke.

500
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:41,714
湖里的人都是他的信徒
People in the lake were his followers.

501
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,717
他们怎么了
What happened to them?

502
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,051
这类邪教经常会遭遇到的事
The same thing that always happens with these cults.

503
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:47,686
所有人都死了
Everybody dies.

504
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:52,024
但是这都是一百多年前的事了 为什么你要
But this was over 100 years ago. Why are you...

505
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:52,865
因为我觉得可能
Because I still think

506
00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:54,593
还有些信徒在这附近活动
there might be some followers kicking around.

507
00:25:54,628 --> 00:25:55,928
你在逗我吧
Come on, seriously?

508
00:25:55,963 --> 00:25:57,996
昨晚 我看见湖边有群人
Last night, I saw these people down by the lake.

509
00:25:58,032 --> 00:25:59,868
他们戴着面具
They were wearing these masks.

510
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:01,355
昨晚可是化妆舞会
Well, it was a masked ball.

511
00:26:01,483 --> 00:26:03,702
我的意思是 谁都有可能戴着面具
I mean, they could have been anyone.

512
00:26:03,738 --> 00:26:05,738
可能吧
Yeah, maybe.

513
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,706
但我还是想来检查一下这个地方
But I still wanted to come check this place out,

514
00:26:07,742 --> 00:26:09,662
确保没人在这儿滋事
make sure nobody's been digging around,

515
00:26:09,677 --> 00:26:10,743
有什么歪主意
getting ideas.

516
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,715
看
Look.

517
00:26:37,905 --> 00:26:39,872
这特么是啥
What the hell is that?

518
00:26:39,907 --> 00:26:43,642
在十九世纪人们就用这个来记录事情
This is how people used to record things in the 19th century.

519
00:26:43,677 --> 00:26:47,613
霍利尤克 就是你刚刚说的那个人
"Holyoke"... that's the guy you were just talking about.

520
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,047
就是他 对吧
That's him, right?

521
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:51,016
还有别的东西
There's something else.

522
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,586
那是什么 硬币吗
What is that, a coin?

523
00:26:54,622 --> 00:26:56,588
是个袖扣
It's a cufflink.

524
00:26:56,624 --> 00:26:58,524
JS
J.S.

525
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,892
杰克・赛克斯
Jack Sykes.

526
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,829
这个是我爸爸的
This belonged to my father.

527
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:14,606
你觉得她会来吗
You think she's gonna come?

528
00:27:14,642 --> 00:27:17,576
只有一个办法确认
Only one way to find out.

529
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:19,645
去那儿等她
Get down there and wait for her.

530
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,581
这我能做到 谢了
I can do that. Thanks.

531
00:27:22,616 --> 00:27:24,550
嘿
Hey!

532
00:27:24,585 --> 00:27:25,951
嘿
Hey!

533
00:27:25,986 --> 00:27:27,986
你去哪
Where you going?

534
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:30,022
去欣赏血月
Uh, to watch the Blood Moon.

535
00:27:30,057 --> 00:27:31,824
一个人吗
Alone?

536
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,725
希望不是
Hopefully not.

537
00:27:33,761 --> 00:27:34,793
有什么问题吗
Is there a problem?

538
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:36,762
小心点
Just be careful.

539
00:27:36,797 --> 00:27:39,631
肯定的啦 老爸
Sure thing, Dad.

540
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:42,668
嘿 谢谢你的磁带 兄弟
Hey, um... thanks for the tape, buddy.

541
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,636
嗯 我也不喜欢“兄弟”这个称呼
Yeah, I don't like "Buddy," Either.

542
00:27:45,773 --> 00:27:48,607
嘿
Hey.

543
00:27:48,642 --> 00:27:50,576
祝你好运 我希望她会去赴约
Good luck. I hope she shows.

544
00:27:50,611 --> 00:27:51,944
谢了
Thanks.

545
00:27:53,948 --> 00:27:54,947
杰西呢
Where's Jessie?

546
00:27:54,982 --> 00:27:56,915
她和赛克斯在一起
She's with Sykes.

547
00:27:56,951 --> 00:27:58,517
她还好吗
Is she okay?

548
00:27:58,552 --> 00:27:59,918
她挺好的 你这是怎么了
She's fine. What's wrong with you?

549
00:27:59,954 --> 00:28:03,655
我只是想确认一下她还好
I'm just making sure that she's okay.

550
00:28:03,691 --> 00:28:04,691
嘿
Hey.

551
00:28:04,692 --> 00:28:05,724
我想确认所有人的安全
That everyone's safe.

552
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:07,352
没人会安全
No one is.

553
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:10,729
没人会安全 除非你杀掉艾米
No one is until you kill Amy.

554
00:28:17,037 --> 00:28:18,637
伙计们
Guys.

555
00:28:18,672 --> 00:28:21,038
戴伯让我们现在都过去
Deb needs us now.

556
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:24,843
你把它丢在哪了 甜心
Where did you leave it, sweetheart?

557
00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:25,911
-你还记得吗 -发生什么了
- Do you remember? - What happened?

558
00:28:25,946 --> 00:28:27,012
她把她的吸入器弄丢了
She lost her inhaler.

559
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:29,047
如果我们没法找到的话 她就不能呼吸了
She can't breathe if we don't get it back.

560
00:28:30,851 --> 00:28:33,819
不然别人就会死
Or someone else will die.

561
00:28:33,854 --> 00:28:35,213
嘿 弗朗茜 你觉得
Hey, Francie, do you think

562
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,723
你有可能把它落在我们早些时候停下的地方吗
you might have left it where we stopped earlier?

563
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:38,824
-是吗 -我去找找
- Yeah? - I'll go get it.

564
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:40,692
-我和你一起去 -不
- I'll go with you. - No.

565
00:28:40,728 --> 00:28:41,760
你就呆在这里
You stay here.

566
00:28:41,795 --> 00:28:43,635
嘿 听着 也许艾米应该和你一起去
Hey, listen, maybe Amy should go.

567
00:28:43,664 --> 00:28:44,663
你最近有点不在状态
You've been a little out of sorts lately.

568
00:28:44,698 --> 00:28:45,697
不 我可以的
No, I can do this.

569
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:46,732
我必须去
I have to do this.

570
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:49,001
拿着这个
Here, take this.

571
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:51,694
以防万一
Just in case.

572
00:28:54,642 --> 00:28:56,602
你还有别的事要去做
You have something else to do.

573
00:28:58,913 --> 00:29:01,813
不 她不会死的
No. She's not dying.

574
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:04,649
没有人会死
No one is.

575
00:29:11,494 --> 00:29:14,228
你知道你爸以前来过这里吗
Did you know your dad had been here before?

576
00:29:14,264 --> 00:29:18,199
我几天前才知道有这个地方的存在
I didn't even know this place existed until a few days ago.

577
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,271
你觉得他在这里干什么
What do you think he was doing here?

578
00:29:23,306 --> 00:29:25,640
考虑到我们是在这里找到这个的
Considering where we found this,

579
00:29:25,675 --> 00:29:27,555
他应该是在和我们做一样的事
he was doing the same thing we are.

580
00:29:32,482 --> 00:29:35,550
吾闪亮的清晨之使
My bright ambassadors of morning!

581
00:29:35,585 --> 00:29:39,454
此即和平之时
It is time to make peace.

582
00:29:39,489 --> 00:29:42,323
卸下重担
Lay down your burden.

583
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:44,225
是他吗 霍利尤克
Is that him... Holyoke?

584
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,596
服下药剂 安静前行
Take the potion and step through quietly.

585
00:29:48,632 --> 00:29:50,198
药剂
Potion?

586
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:52,233
我觉得他是在让他们自杀
I think he's telling them to kill themselves.

587
00:29:52,268 --> 00:29:55,603
相信湖水的力量
Believe in the power of the lake,

588
00:29:55,639 --> 00:29:59,574
它将揭示真相
and it will reveal the truth.

589
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:02,377
他是恶魔
He was evil.

590
00:30:02,412 --> 00:30:03,444
但他的信徒们
But his followers?

591
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,446
他们对他言听计从
They did anything he told them.

592
00:30:07,317 --> 00:30:08,383
言听计从
Anything.

593
00:30:08,418 --> 00:30:12,220
服下药剂 大步前行
Take the potion and step through.

594
00:30:48,692 --> 00:30:49,624
不
No.

595
00:30:53,563 --> 00:30:55,463
不
No.

596
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:58,599
你是谁
Who are you?!

597
00:30:58,635 --> 00:31:00,501
你到底想要我干什么
What do you want from me?!

598
00:31:00,537 --> 00:31:03,438
和我想要迈克尔做的事一样
The same thing I wanted from Michael...

599
00:31:03,473 --> 00:31:07,375
让你服从我的命令
for you to do what I say.

600
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:17,218
你在干什么
What are you doing?!

601
00:31:17,253 --> 00:31:19,320
你在做什么
What are you doing?!

602
00:31:47,751 --> 00:31:49,717
你在这里做什么
What are you doing here?

603
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:51,352
我担心你
I was worried.

604
00:31:51,387 --> 00:31:53,254
你不应该独自一个人在外面
You shouldn't be out here alone.

605
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:58,526
杀了她
Kill her.

606
00:31:58,561 --> 00:31:59,527
杀了她
Do it.

607
00:32:00,563 --> 00:32:01,629
现在就杀了她
Now.

608
00:32:01,664 --> 00:32:03,531
乔尔
Joel?

609
00:32:03,566 --> 00:32:04,846
你在做什么
What are you doing?

610
00:32:09,506 --> 00:32:12,340
她不死 别人就要死
Her, or someone else.

611
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:17,411
她不死 别人就要死
Her, or someone else.

612
00:32:17,447 --> 00:32:20,314
她不死 别人就要死
Her, or someone else.

613
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,216
她不死 别人就要死
Her, or someone else.

614
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,319
乔尔
Joel.

615
00:32:25,355 --> 00:32:27,555
乔尔
Joel.

616
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:30,591
放下你的刀
Put down the knife.

617
00:32:30,627 --> 00:32:31,659
-杀死她 -不
- Kill! - No.

618
00:32:31,694 --> 00:32:33,494
杀死她 杀死她
Kill her! Kill her!

619
00:32:36,533 --> 00:32:38,366
他永远不会放过我的
He'll never leave me alone.

620
00:32:38,401 --> 00:32:41,435
谁 这里没有别人
Who? There's no one here.

621
00:32:41,471 --> 00:32:43,504
乔尔 不要 不要
Joel, stop! Stop!

622
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,666
杀死她
Kill her!

623
00:32:44,813 --> 00:32:46,340
这里没有别人
There's no one here.

624
00:32:46,376 --> 00:32:48,409
这里没有别人
There's no one here.

625
00:32:51,381 --> 00:32:53,714
一切都会好起来的 深呼吸
Everything's gonna be okay. Just breathe.

626
00:32:57,587 --> 00:32:58,619
没事的
It's okay.

627
00:32:58,655 --> 00:33:01,622
没事的
It's okay.

628
00:33:04,169 --> 00:33:07,067
-给你 回家注意安全 -好的
- Here you go. Get home safe. - Okay.

629
00:33:20,115 --> 00:33:21,948
肯尼还好吗
Is Kenny okay?

630
00:33:21,984 --> 00:33:23,016
不 他一点都不好
No, he's not okay.

631
00:33:23,051 --> 00:33:24,317
你打断了他的鼻子
You broke his nose,

632
00:33:24,353 --> 00:33:27,320
而他也不相信你蹩脚的借口
and he didn't buy your lame excuse, either.

633
00:33:27,356 --> 00:33:28,922
我喝醉了
I was drunk.

634
00:33:28,957 --> 00:33:30,237
你只是在车里喝了半杯啤酒
You had half a beer in the limo.

635
00:33:30,292 --> 00:33:31,358
到底怎么了 乔尔
What's going on, Joel?

636
00:33:31,393 --> 00:33:34,127
-告诉我实话 -我早就告诉你了
- Tell me the truth. - I already told you.

637
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:39,199
我也认识迈克 你现在的行为和他一模一样
I knew Michael, too, and you're acting just like him.

638
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:42,035
迈克把事情都藏在自己心里 这就害死了他
Michael kept everything inside, and it killed him.

639
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,136
如果那时他寻求帮助的话
If he'd asked for help...

640
00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:45,071
害死他的是他被别人当做怪物
What killed him was being seen as a freak.

641
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:48,375
他告诉我父母的那一刻
The minute he told my parents,

642
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,010
他们都当他是一个发了疯的孩子
they looked at him like a crazy kid.

643
00:33:50,045 --> 00:33:52,245
从此他们再也没有用正常的眼光看他
They never looked at him the same.

644
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:55,382
我绝对不会这样对你的
I will never look at you like that.

645
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:57,250
你在我面前不需要伪装 乔尔
You don't have to pretend with me, Joel.

646
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:59,252
你不需要是完美无缺的
You don't have to be perfect.

647
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:01,121
告诉我吧
Just talk with me.

648
00:34:01,156 --> 00:34:03,056
我想要帮助你
I want to help you.

649
00:34:07,229 --> 00:34:08,962
我不需要你的帮助
I don't need your help.

650
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,069
我们分手吧
We're done.

651
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:25,345
嘿
Hey.

652
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:29,276
好了 弗朗茜可以正常呼吸了
Well, Francie's breathing normally again.

653
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:31,284
她会没事的
She's gonna be okay.

654
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,186
多亏了你
Thanks to you.

655
00:34:33,221 --> 00:34:35,155
现在所有人都去睡觉吧
Now, everybody, get to bed.

656
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:38,091
大家都辛苦了
It's been a long night... for all of us.

657
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:41,127
我也是时候去赴约了对吧
Guess that's my cue, too, right?

658
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:43,029
所以你要去见他吗
So you're gonna go meet him?

659
00:34:43,065 --> 00:34:45,025
总要试一下吧
Got to give it a shot.

660
00:34:46,935 --> 00:34:47,968
我为你骄傲
I'm proud of you.

661
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,903
看看事情怎么发展再夸我吧
Hold the pride till we see how it goes.

662
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:54,975
嘿 布莱尔
Uh, hey, Blair?

663
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:59,245
你说吧 没关系
Go ahead. It's okay.

664
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,283
我要和你们谈谈
I need to talk to you guys.

665
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:12,025
我一生都努力变得强壮
My whole life, I've tried to be strong.

666
00:35:14,997 --> 00:35:17,063
就是 装作一切都很好的样子
You know, act like everything was fine,

667
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:19,933
但我还没有对你们坦诚相待
but I haven't been honest about who I really am.

668
00:35:21,903 --> 00:35:23,583
我之前有一个哥哥
I used to have a brother.

669
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:28,061
迈克尔
Michael.

670
00:35:30,912 --> 00:35:33,246
当迈克尔像我这么大的时候 他自杀了
When Michael was my age, he killed himself.

671
00:35:37,285 --> 00:35:41,187
他看见 一些不存在的东西
He saw things that... weren't there.

672
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:45,191
迈克尔生病了
Michael had a sickness.

673
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,095
而现在我也得了这个病
And now I have that sickness, too.

674
00:35:54,036 --> 00:35:57,904
我的摄像机曾是我唯一能够信任的东西
My camera used to be the only thing that I could trust

675
00:35:57,939 --> 00:35:59,205
它告诉我什么是真实的
to show me what's real.

676
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,066
它从来都不会骗我
It never lied.

677
00:36:05,881 --> 00:36:07,201
但是现在摄像机都没用了
But now the camera's not working,

678
00:36:07,215 --> 00:36:09,215
而我也感觉越来越糟糕
and I'm getting worse.

679
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:11,184
什么意思
What do you mean?

680
00:36:13,155 --> 00:36:15,188
有个男人
There's a man.

681
00:36:15,223 --> 00:36:18,124
在我来营地之前我就开始见到他
I started seeing him before I ever came to camp.

682
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,961
我觉得和迈克尔看到的是同一个人
I think Michael saw the same man.

683
00:36:21,997 --> 00:36:25,865
他自始至终没有放过他
He never left him alone.

684
00:36:25,901 --> 00:36:29,335
现在他一直跟着我 让我做一些事情
And now he's following me, asking me to do things.

685
00:36:31,306 --> 00:36:32,338
一些坏事
Terrible things.

686
00:36:32,374 --> 00:36:33,940
比如什么
Like what?

687
00:36:33,975 --> 00:36:37,277
今晚他让我杀死艾米
Tonight he told me to kill Amy.

688
00:36:39,214 --> 00:36:41,214
否则别人就会死掉
Or else someone else would die.

689
00:36:44,186 --> 00:36:46,119
他不是真实的
He's not real.

690
00:36:46,154 --> 00:36:48,988
-你知道的是吗 -这就是问题所在
- You know that, right? - That's just it.

691
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,924
我再也不知道什么是真 什么是假了
I don't know what's real and what isn't anymore,

692
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:51,991
我很担心
and I'm worried.

693
00:36:52,027 --> 00:36:58,832
如果我找不到办法摆脱他的话
If I don't find a way to stop seeing him...

694
00:36:58,867 --> 00:37:00,747
我会和迈克尔落得一样的下场
I'm gonna end up just like Michael.

695
00:37:01,937 --> 00:37:05,205
我得离开营地
I need to leave camp.

696
00:37:08,276 --> 00:37:10,110
我需要帮助
I need help.

697
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,246
我们也会帮你的 乔尔
We'll help you, too, Joel.

698
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:16,149
任何事都可以
Whatever you need.

699
00:37:16,184 --> 00:37:18,985
你不需要向我们隐瞒
You don't have to hide things from us.

700
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,121
我们会帮助你的
We're here for you.

701
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,524
谢谢
Thanks.

702
00:37:26,928 --> 00:37:27,927
我错过了什么
What'd I miss?

703
00:37:29,965 --> 00:37:32,932
这一夜真长啊
It's been a night.

704
00:37:32,968 --> 00:37:33,967
我也这么觉得
You and me both.

705
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,935
我在树林里碰见了加勒特
I ran into Garrett in the woods.

706
00:37:35,971 --> 00:37:37,971
他在查看一个旧小屋
He was checking out this old cabin.

707
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,926
我们找到了一个邪教首领的录音
We found recordings of this cult leader

708
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:41,908
他让他的追随者们自杀
telling all of his followers to kill themselves.

709
00:37:41,943 --> 00:37:43,143
霍利尤克
Holyoke.

710
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,082
你也知道他吗
You know about him, too?

711
00:37:45,192 --> 00:37:46,746
加勒特让我什么都不要说
Garrett told me not to say anything.

712
00:37:46,888 --> 00:37:48,214
他不想我们害怕
He didn't want us freaking out.

713
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,116
没有什么好害怕的
There's nothing to freak out about.

714
00:37:50,152 --> 00:37:54,053
他已经死了 但是他还是很恐怖
He's dead. Still, he's pretty creepy.

715
00:37:57,058 --> 00:37:58,958
乔尔 怎么了
Joel, what is it?

716
00:38:00,128 --> 00:38:02,095
就是他
That's him.

717
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:05,098
就是他一直跟着我
That's the man who's been following me.

718
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:08,034
乔尔 如果你的哥哥没有生病呢
Joel, what if your brother wasn't sick?

719
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:12,839
如果他曾看见的这个人 你现在一直看见的这个人
What if the man he saw... the one you've been seeing...

720
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:14,274
就是霍利尤克呢
what if that was Holyoke?

721
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:16,242
是鬼魂吗 你开玩笑的吧
Ghosts? Seriously?

722
00:38:16,278 --> 00:38:17,877
这就是我一直在说的
It's what I've been saying.

723
00:38:17,913 --> 00:38:20,213
是这个地方的问题
It's this place.

724
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:25,218
这里有些东西不对劲 它了解我们
There's something here. Something that knows us.

725
00:38:25,253 --> 00:38:30,089
是这个地方 它了解我们的弱点
This place, it feeds on our weaknesses,

726
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:32,225
而霍利尤克和这肯定有什么关系
and Holyoke has something to do with it.

727
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,226
别开玩笑了 艾米
Come on, Amy.

728
00:38:33,261 --> 00:38:35,028
就算这是真的
Even if that were true,

729
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,095
为什么只有乔尔看见过他
why is Joel the only one who's seen him?

730
00:38:36,131 --> 00:38:39,596
他不是唯一一个见过他的
He isn't the only one.

731
00:38:41,136 --> 00:38:45,104
那个高大的男人 是他
The Tall Man... that was him.

732
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:48,875
你也见过他吗
You've seen him, too?

733
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,977
为什么是我们
Why us?

734
00:38:51,012 --> 00:38:52,629
他想要什么
What does he want?

735
00:38:52,755 --> 00:38:55,348
他告诉过你他想要什么
He told you what he wants.

736
00:38:55,383 --> 00:38:56,883
你没有照做
You didn't listen.

737
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,218
他说了什么
What did he say?

738
00:38:58,253 --> 00:38:59,886
他有没有告诉你为什么他要和我们说话
Did he tell you why he's speaking to us?

739
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,221
没有
No.

740
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,189
他说了什么
What did he say?

741
00:39:03,225 --> 00:39:06,125
他说你应该杀死她的
He said you should have killed her

742
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:07,897
你错过了你的机会
when you had the chance.

743
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,933
有人吗
Hello?

744
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,914
克瑞克特 是你吗
Cricket, is that you?

745
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:19,023
