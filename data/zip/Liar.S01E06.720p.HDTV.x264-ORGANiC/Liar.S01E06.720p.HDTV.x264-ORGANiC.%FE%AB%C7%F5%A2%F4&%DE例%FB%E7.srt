19
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,170
-你干了什么  凯蒂  -都结束了  所以不重要了
- What have you done, Katy? - It's over, so it doesn't matter.

20
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,940
别走
Please don't Leave!

21
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:07,830
发生什么事了
What happened?

22
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,640
你还是问问你老婆吧
Why don't you ask your wife?

23
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,460
你是相信我的  对吧
You do believe me, don't you?

24
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,670
你相信我绝不会做出那样的事
You believe that I couldn't do something Like that?

25
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,900
当然  我相信你
Yeah. Course I do.

26
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,860
我就是个垃圾收集者  我什么也改变不了
I'm just a rubbish collector. I don't change anything.

27
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,550
我只能清理那些垃圾
I just sweep up the crap

28
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,580
而第二天它们又出现了
and the next day it's all just there again.

29
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,130
你做的事是重要的  它可以改变人们的生活
What you do is important. It makes a difference to people.

30
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,490
也是我当初爱上你的原因之一
It's one of the reasons I fell for you in the first place.

31
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,540
我只在乎他要对自己的行为负责任
All I care about is him answering for what he's done.

32
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,870
他们会找到证据  证明你强奸了我
They're gonna find proof that you raped me!

33
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,140
不  不会的  警探  不会的
No, you won't, Detective. No, you won't.

34
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:57,130
{\an9}谁在撒谎
第一季第六集[本季终]

35
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,790
爸爸  怎么了
Dad? What's going on?

36
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,050
对不起  我没想把你吵醒的
Ah, I'm sorry, mate. I didn't mean to wake you up.

37
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,960
你去哪里了
Where have you been?

38
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,260
我告诉你也不会信的
You won't believe me if I told you.

39
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,330
这不重要
It's not important.

40
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,990
不过你只要知道
All you need to know is, though, er...

41
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,870
还没有结束
it's not over.

42
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,150
-什么  -警察
- What? - The police.

43
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,030
我不明白  他们就是不肯放过我
I don't understand it, they just won't let it lie.

44
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,860
你的老师对我
It wasn't enough that your teacher

45
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,870
提出那种指控还不够  现在警探...
made all those accusations against me, now the detective...

46
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,350
爸爸  出什么事了
Dad, what's going on?

47
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,340
警探也指控我
The detective is accusing me, too.

48
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,840
她说我攻击了她
She's saying that I attacked her.

49
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,950
她说几天前晚上
She's saying that a couple of nights ago

50
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,590
我闯进了她家
I broke into her house.

51
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,100
那太疯狂了
That's crazy. I mean,

52
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,960
你已经证明尼尔森老师之前也撒过谎...
You already proved that Miss Nielson was lying before...

53
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,370
人们不能就这样乱泼脏水  爸爸
People can't just go around saying this stuff, Dad.

54
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,600
这样不对  告诉她上级
It's not right. Just tell her boss.

55
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,310
肯定有人能阻止这一切的
There must be someone who can make this stop.

56
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,700
警察只会护着自己人
The police, you see, they look after their own.

57
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,120
他们就是这样
That's how they work.

58
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,150
不管她怎么说  他们都会信
Whatever she says, they'll back her up.

59
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,650
我们两人只能各执一词
It's just her word against mine.

60
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,390
我完蛋了
And I'll be destroyed.

61
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,020
除非
Unless er...

62
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,050
不知道  如果...也许如果
I don't know. What er... What if maybe er...

63
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,720
你告诉他们你看到过我
you told them that you saw me?

64
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,940
你想让我对警察撒谎
You want me to lie to the police?

65
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,120
不不不  天啊  不是那样的
No, no, no. God, nothing like that.

66
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,970
只是
Just erm...

67
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,740
我需要你的帮助  就像我
I need your help. You know, in the same way

68
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,870
帮你对付马可达的爸爸那样
that I helped you with Makeda's father?

69
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,630
那种善意的谎言
The kind of lie that's a good lie?

70
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,900
伙计
Look, mate...

71
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:20,320
我很不想这样要你帮忙  好吗
I feel sick to my stomach asking you, all right?

72
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,830
可我很害怕
But I'm afraid.

73
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,940
老实说  伙计  我真的很怕
To be honest with you, mate, I'm really scared.

74
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,590
他们要弄死我...
They want blood and...

75
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,300
他们...他们完全不会罢休
..They'll... they won't stop at anything.

76
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,720
天啊  如果我保护不了自己  谁来保护你
Christ, if I can't protect myself, who's gonna protect you?

77
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,200
天啊  对不起
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

78
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,310
对不起  忘了我刚说的一切  好吗
I'm so sorry, just forget that I asked, 0K?

79
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,670
忘了我的请求
Forget that I asked.

80
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,870
太尴尬了  原谅我
I'm so embarrassed. Please forgive me.

81
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,470
对不起那样要求你  忘了吧
I'm so sorry that I asked, 0K? Just forget about it.

82
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,650
我到底怎么了  我都没法...
Christ, what's happening to me? I can't even...

83
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,440
不管你需要什么  爸爸
Whatever you need, Dad.

84
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,240
不管你需要什么  我都会告诉他们
I'll tell them whatever you need.

85
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,370
我不会让他们这么对你的
I'm not gonna let them do this to you.

86
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,730
谢谢你
Thank you.

87
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,180
天啊  谢谢你
Oh, my God, thank you.

88
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,960
谢谢你  伙计
Thanks, mate.

89
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,540
你为什么觉得这次会不一样
What makes you think it'll be different this time?

90
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,010
你为什么觉得你能把他抓起来
What makes you think you can put him away?

91
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,050
让我来操心安德鲁·厄拉姆的事
You need to let me worry about Andrew Earlham.

92
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,080
-等你...  -等我们提出指控就给你电话
- Will you call me as soon as you - As soon as we press charges.

93
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,670
我保证
I promise.

94
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,770
好的
Ok.

95
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:08,640
{\an9}三个月后

96
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,940
-旅途怎么样  -很不错  谢谢
- How was the journey down? - Good. Really easy. Thanks.

97
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,240
-你应该让我来找你的  -不不不
- You really should have let me come to you. - Oh, no, no, no.

98
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,870
这里很不错  我一直很想来这里
This is nice. I always wanted to come here.

99
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,120
你看上去不错
You look good.

100
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,700
不是说你平时看上去不好
Not that you don't always look good.

101
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,790
谢谢
Thanks.

102
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,720
喝的
OK. Er, drinks.

103
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,690
你想喝点什么
What can I get you?

104
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,940
我去拿吧  如果你不介意的话
Actually, I'll get them, if you don't mind.

105
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,210
拜托  让我去吧
Please. Let me.

106
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,970
好的
Ok.

107
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,660
去吧  跑跑跑跑跑
Go on. Run, run, run, run.

108
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,650
快跑
Run!

109
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,410
不不  你们别动
No, no, you're staying there.

110
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,860
孩子们来了  玩得开心吗
Yeah, there's my boys. Did you have a good time?

111
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,610
你们玩得开心吗
Did you have fun?

112
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,440
去吧  我烧好茶了
Go on, I've got tea ready for you.

113
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,450
我马上就来
I'll be with you in a second.

114
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,490
他们一直问我会不会留下来
So they kept asking if I was going to stay.

115
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,000
是啊...
Well, it's er...

116
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,750
他们可能需要点时间习惯
it's gonna take some time for them to get used to it.

117
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,630
但他们会习惯的
But they will.

118
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,040
他们没必要习惯
They don't have to.

119
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,280
是你的错  凯蒂
You did this, Katy.

120
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,480
-不关别人的事  -我只想求你
- No-one else. - All I'm asking

121
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,250
我们为了他们试试
is that we try, for them.

122
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,120
我不想让他们在成长的过程中
I don't want them growing

123
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,400
被我们两边拖拽
up being pulled in two different directions,

124
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,730
-夹在中间  -我也不想那样
- caught in the middle - And I don't want that either.

125
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,640
但你的所作所为
But what you did...

126
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,830
我没法忘记
I can't forget that.

127
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:04,930
也没法原谅
Or forgive it.

128
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,840
爸爸来了
Daddy's coming.

129
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,630
周二见
See you on Tuesday.

130
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,620
我在地铁上  给一位女士让了座
So I was on the Tube and I offered my seat to this, erm, lady,

131
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,420
她问  为什么
and she said, 'Why?'

132
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,660
我说  因为你怀孕了
And I said, 'Well, because you're pregnant.'

133
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,510
-她说  我没有怀孕  -天啊
- And she said, 'l'm not pregnant.' - Oh, my God.

134
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,780
-你说了什么  -我想不到该说什么
- What did you say? - I couldn't think of anything to say.

135
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,920
她看上去就像怀孕了
I mean, she looked pregnant.

136
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,160
肚子的形状
From the shape of it.

137
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,950
我本来很确定...
l was really sure...

138
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,170
也许她只会觉得你很绅士
Maybe she just thought you were being chivalrous.

139
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,520
让座给一个胖子吗
By offering my seat to a fat person?

140
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,240
所以现在我只要在车上看到有人站着
So now whenever I'm on a train and I see someone standing,

141
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,590
我脑中就会浮现出无数想法
l have a million thoughts going through my head.

142
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,360
她们真的是怀孕了吗  他们是不是没那么老
Are they not actually pregnant? Are they not that old?

143
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,090
她们是不是女的
Are they not even a woman?

144
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,950
简直是个雷区
It's a minefield.

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,530
这也太不公平了
It's not fair, though, is it?

146
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,150
你只是想做点好事  然后...
You were just trying to do something nice and...

147
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,510
怎么了  怎么回事
What? What is it?

148
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,450
怎么了  那是谁
What is it? Who is that?

149
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:41,760
劳拉  是他吗
Laura, is that him?

150
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,210
这不重要
It doesn't matter.

151
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,400
天啊
Jesus.

152
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,880
他被二次调查了  对吗
He was investigated a second time, right?

153
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,060
警察把他的生活翻了个底朝天  什么都没发现
Police turned his life upside down and found precisely nothing.

154
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,680
他们就把他放了吗
They just let him go?

155
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,560
就算哈蒙警长指控了他
Even after DI Harmon's charges,

156
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,330
他们也找不到抓他的证据
they couldn't find anything to put him away.

157
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,540
我想是因为他知道怎么销毁证据吧
He knows how to cover his tracks, I suppose.

158
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,550
难以想象你看到他这样逍遥法外的感受
I can't imagine what it must feel like to see him walking around.

159
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,980
我愤怒了很久  但是...
Well, I've been angry for long time, but erm...

160
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,690
这会消耗你
it wastes you.

161
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,380
会把你吞噬掉
It eats away at you and erm...

162
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,870
每当我有这种感觉时
Every time I feel that way,

163
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,650
感觉就像是事情再一次发生
it's like it's happening all over again,

164
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,470
所以在某一刻  不得不放手
so at some point you have to... let it go or...

165
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,340
或者至少试一试
try to, at least.

166
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,630
这杯敬你
Here's to you.

167
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,900
-还有多久  -一个月
- So how much longer? - A month.

168
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:54,120
-你找到新地方了吗  -没 很理智吧
- Have you found a new place yet? - No. Sensible, hey?

169
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,700
我只是觉得
I just felt like

170
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,640
离开这个鬼地方是当务之急
getting the hell out of this place was the priority,

171
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,790
但我看的所有房子
but everything I look at,

172
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,840
都不太好  要么太小  要么离公路太近
all I see is the bad stuff too small, too close to a road.

173
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,610
有个房子颜色太黄了
One place was too yellow.

174
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,210
那真不能要
That's a deal breaker.

175
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,500
谢谢你让我过了一个愉快的夜晚
Thanks for a lovely night.

176
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,330
真的很高兴跟你见面
Yeah, it was... it was really good seeing you.

177
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,070
抱歉  你一路送我回来
I'm sorry. You've come all this way

178
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,700
-而我却不请你进屋  -不不  没事
- and I'm not even inviting you in. - No, no, not at all.

179
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,120
那下周见
See you next week?

180
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,040
下周见
Next week it is.

181
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,810
晚安  伊恩
Good night, Ian.

182
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,110
晚安  劳拉
Good night, Laura.

183
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,610
就喝一杯  街角就有家很棒的小酒吧
One drink. There's a beautiful little pub just round the corner.

184
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,420
你现在已经和我约会这么多次了
You've been on enough dates with me now.

185
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,510
你觉得我这么容易被说服吗
Do you think I'm easily persuaded?

186
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,020
至少我试了
At least I tried.

187
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,340
但下次吃晚饭  我坚持由我来做饭
But next time, dinner, I'll cook, I insist.

188
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,790
如果我做瑞士千层酥皮鲑鱼
If I make my salmon en croute,

189
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,250
也许我儿子就会走开
maybe my son will bugger off.

190
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,700
也许我们就能单独相处一会
We might have a moment to ourselves.

191
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,470
-那好吧  -太好了
- All right, then. - Yes.

192
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,890
晚安
Good night.

193
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,970
晚安
Good night.

194
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,500
好了  晚安
OK, good night.

195
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,660
下次见
Till next time.

196
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,700
夏洛特  你好
Charlotte? Hi.

197
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,250
我叫劳拉·尼尔森
I'm Laura Nielson.

198
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,170
感谢你能来
I appreciate you coming.

199
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,290
你应该知道安德鲁和我说起过你
You should know Andrew told me about you.

200
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,400
他怎么说的
What did he say exactly?

201
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,770
我第一次见他时  他就跟我说了
He told me, the first time I met him,

202
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,810
关于你给他带来的那些麻烦
about all the trouble you'd caused him.

203
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,450
在那之后  他删除了所有社交媒体账号
He deleted all of his social media accounts after that,

204
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,900
用别名注册了一个新账户
set up a new one under an alias

205
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,470
结果你还是找到了他
and yet you still found him.

206
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,340
还有我
And me.

207
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,920
我应该防着你吗
Should I be worried about you?

208
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,360
安德鲁·厄拉姆强奸了我
Andrew Earlham raped me.

209
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,860
强奸了一位名叫凡妮莎·哈蒙的警探
He raped a police officer called Vanessa Harmon,

210
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,230
在爱丁堡强奸了一位叫凯瑟琳·麦考利的女子
and he raped a woman called Catherine MacAulay in Edinburgh.

211
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,200
这是她们的号码
Here are their numbers.

212
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,900
如果你不相信我  那就跟她们聊聊吧
If you don't believe me, then talk to them.

213
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,200
然后再作出判断  你觉得谁说的是真话
Then you make up your mind who you think is telling the truth,

214
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,610
是我们三人  还是安德鲁
the three of us or Andrew.

215
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,540
我不认识你  但是我知道他
Look, I don't know you, but I know him,

216
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,770
我知道他能做出些什么事
and I know what he's capable of.

217
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,280
他喜欢聪慧  独立
He likes women who are smart, independent,

218
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,370
更有挑战的女人
more of a challenge to control.

219
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,440
但愿你够聪明  能多留点神
I'm hoping you're smart enough to watch your back.

220
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,860
或者至少
Or at least...

221
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,470
够聪明地自己去查一查我跟你说的事
smart enough to check out what I'm telling you for yourself.

222
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,070
她真美
Aw. She's gorgeous.

223
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,180
-是吗  -她甚至有你那种能看穿人的头脑
- Is she? - Yeah, look, she's even got your see-through head.

224
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,870
如果是女孩的话
That's if she is a she.

225
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:32,730
你还好吧
Are you all right?

226
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,220
还好  我只是
Yeah, I'm just...

227
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,230
心不在焉
miles away.

228
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,910
我回来后  你一直这样
You have been since I got back.

229
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,360
还有一次出差任务
Look, it's... it's one more tour of duty,

230
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,920
然后我就能回家了  不再是珍妮佛大兵了
and then I'm home, right? No more GI Jennifer.

231
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,830
分娩之前我会回来的  然后我哪也不去了
I'll be back before the birth and then I'm not going anywhere.

232
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,220
我只是想你了
Yeah. I just miss you, that's all.

233
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,110
你骗不了我  妮莎
You can't lie to me, Ness.

234
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,640
发生什么事了  你一脸愁容
What's going on? You've got that look.

235
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,820
-没事  -听着
- It's nothing. - Look,

236
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,140
我可以一直问到你受不了为止
I can keep asking you, again and again till I drive you crazy

237
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,340
或者你现在就告诉我
or you can just tell me now.

238
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,930
别问了  好吗  我没事
Just leave it, OK, I am fine.

239
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,000
你就告诉我吧
Just tell me.

240
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,780
妮莎
Ness...

241
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,130
你变了
you've changed.

242
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,520
你努力想要掩盖  但是
You've tried to pretend, but...

243
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,930
但我知道
but I know what...

244
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,730
我只是想要听实话
All I'm asking for is the truth.

245
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,730
是有其他人吗
Is there someone else?

246
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,490
天  不是的  当然不是
God, no. Of course not.

247
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,380
那  到底怎么回事
Well, then, what is it?

248
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,320
你走的这些天里  发生了一些事  但拜托
While you were away, something happened, but please...

249
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,590
我不能  我不想说出口
please, I can't, I don't want to say it out loud.

250
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,970
不管是什么事  都没事的
Whatever it is, it's OK.

251
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,080
你可以告诉我  怎么回事
You can tell me. You can tell me, what is it?

252
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,100
发生什么了
What is it?

253
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,210
告诉我
Just tell me.

254
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,240
卢克
Luke?

255
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,110
卢克
Luke?

256
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,140
伙计
Hey, mate.

257
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,920
-你怎么样  -挺好
- How are you doing? - Fine.

258
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,630
那就好
Good.

259
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,630
很好
That's good.

260
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,190
我想问问
I was wondering...

261
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,400
在学校还好吗
..How's school, eh?

262
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,580
只是撤销了指控
Just because the charges were dropped,

263
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,710
并不意味着人们不再讨论了  是吧
doesn't mean people don't talk, right?

264
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,870
我知道这对你来说有多不难  但你这样并不能
I know how hard it is for you but it's not gonna get any easier -

265
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,000
别给我什么建议了  爸爸
Spare me the advice, Dad.

266
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,400
就好像你有资格说这些话一样
Like you're in any position.

267
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,750
你什么意思
What do you mean?

268
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,720
你这话什么意思  卢克
What does that mean? Luke?

269
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,240
我洗清了罪名
I was cleared.

270
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,730
所有的罪名都洗得干干净净
All those charges, not one of them stuck.

271
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,650
要是你不相信我  好吧  你和我
If you don't believe me, right, you and me...

272
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,460
要是你
If you...

273
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,480
夏洛特  你好吗
Charlotte. Hey. How are you?

274
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,850
慢点说  慢点说
Slow down, slow down.

275
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,890
什么
What?

276
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,460
什么
What?

277
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,090
她说了什么
What did she say?

278
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,130
{\an9}安德鲁·厄拉姆

279
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,320
你想怎样
What do you want?

280
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,420
我想谈谈  劳拉  我还能想干什么
'I want to talk, Laura. What else would I want?'

281
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,540
你离我远点
You need to leave me alone.

282
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,920
现在睡觉有点早  不是吗
'Bit early to be in bed, isn't it?'

283
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,970
你说什么
What did you say?

284
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,050
你会想我吗  当你躺在那的时候
'Do you think about me? When you're lying there.'

285
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,730
你肯定想起我了  不是吗  尽管你不会承认
'You do, don't you? Even though you wouldn't admit it.'

286
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,530
你现在立刻给我离开这里
You need to get away from here right now.

287
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,640
我知道你和夏洛特聊过
'I know you spoke to Charlotte,

288
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,490
而且我觉得你才是那个该滚开的人
and I think you're the one that needs to back off.

289
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,560
我们是时候继续自己的生活了  你不觉得吗
Time we both got on with our lives, don't you think?'

290
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,810
你觉得你凌驾于所有人和事  是吗
You think you stand above everyone and everything, don't you?

291
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,120
你觉得没人抓得到你
That you're untouchable.

292
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,770
但你也只是个人罢了  安德鲁
But you're just a man, Andrew.

293
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,200
一个恶心脆弱的人
A sick, weak man.

294
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,810
总有一天你会清醒过来
And one day you're gonna wake up

295
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,000
你造成的所有痛苦都将报复到你身上来
and all the pain you've caused is just gonna come back on you.

296
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,260
你听起来很害怕  别怕
You sound scared. Don't be.

297
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,060
因为如果我想占有你
Cos if I wanted to have you...

298
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,540
再次占有你
again...

299
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,630
你不觉得只要我想  随时都能动手吗
don't you think I could have had you whenever I wanted?

300
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,750
-我要报警了  -你有没有回想过那一晚
- I'm calling the police. - 'Do you ever think about that night?'

301
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,080
我知道我回想过
'I know I do.

302
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,040
有花朵图案的床单  粉红的枕套
The floral-patterned sheets, the pink pillowcases,

303
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,700
床上灰色的盖毯
the grey throw on the bed,

304
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,940
肯定是几周前刚换的
which couldn't have been more than a few weeks old.

305
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,710
其中一个商标
One of the tags was still

306
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,720
还挂在右下角
hanging from the bottom right-hand corner.

307
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,060
而你...躺在那儿
And you...lying there.

308
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,310
任由我摆布
Letting me do whatever I wanted.

309
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,310
我只要有机会就会重播  劳拉
I play that back, Laura, whenever I get the chance

310
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,470
好了  再见
All right, I'll see you soon.

311
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,370
-劳拉  -安德鲁昨晚出现在了我家外面
- Laura? - Andrew turned up outside my house last night.

312
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,760
-什么  -是啊  但他什么都没做
- What? - Yeah, he didn't do anything.

313
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,790
他只是想恐吓我  而且他做到了
He just wanted to scare me, and it worked.

314
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,730
我整晚都没睡
I couldn't sleep all night.

315
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:23,610
好的
OK.

316
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,270
我认为他把我们录下来了
I think he filmed us.

317
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,930
他对我们做的那些事
What he did to us.

318
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,010
为什么这么说
Why would you say that?

319
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,110
他谈到了那晚  谈到了...
He talked about that night. He talked about erm...

320
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,360
墙上的一幅画
a picture on my wall...

321
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,050
我床上很小的细节  那些琐碎的小事
some tiny detail about my bed, little things...

322
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,360
他当时在我房间里不可能注意到那些
that he couldn't have noticed in the time he was in my room.

323
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,550
-他有时间四周打探  -他说...
- He had time to look around. - He said...

324
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,970
"我只要有机会就会重播"
"I play that back whenever I get the chance."

325
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,490
不是「我会回想」  而是「我会重播」
Not "I think about it", "I play it back."

326
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,190
可能只是一种说法
Could just be an expression.

327
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,200
他说的那些事  那些细节
The things he said, the detail he went into.

328
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,310
我跟你说  他都录下来了
I'm telling you, he recorded it

329
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,430
而且那个令人作呕的杂种把证据藏在某处
and the sick bastard still has it somewhere.

330
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,120
劳拉...
Laura...

331
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,250
他那样的男人就是想控制和羞辱女性
Men like him want to control and humiliate women.

332
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,410
还有什么比录下来更羞辱人的
What's more humiliating than a recording?

333
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:10,790
别说了  我们搜过他的家  工作地还有电脑
Stop. We searched his house, his work, his computer.

334
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:13,770
以及他的所有电子设备  好吗
Every electronic device he has, OK?

335
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,890
-我们什么都没找着  -我知道
- And we found nothing. - I know.

336
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,700
但他太狡猾了
But he's too smart for that.

337
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,930
劳拉  我需要你
Laura, what I need you to do

338
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,170
什么都不要去做  好吗
is absolutely nothing, OK?

339
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,250
我可以派一辆巡逻警车守在你家外面
Now, I can get a patrol car to stay outside your house.

340
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,750
真棒  我所有问题都解决了  
Great, all my problems are solved

341
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:34,230
听着  你能至少把我说的那些话
Look, will you pass on what I've said at least?

342
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,670
转达给你的那个同事吗  只是...
To your colleagues. Just...

343
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,900
现在和他在一起的那个女人  夏洛特
That woman he's with now, Charlotte,

344
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,770
我希望她平安无事
I want her to be all right.

345
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,280
好的  我会跟他说的
Yeah, sure, I'll pass it on.

346
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:08,390
-你好  警探  -凡妮莎
- Hi, Detective - Vanessa.

347
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,030
-抱歉打扰了  -没事  只是在赶些文书
- Sorry to bother you. - No bother. I'm catching up on paperwork.

348
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,260
我刚刚和劳拉·尼尔森通过电话了
I just spoke with Laura Nielson.

349
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,500
劳拉  我昨天见到她了
Laura, yeah, I met her yesterday.

350
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,850
她认为安德鲁·厄拉姆录下了他的罪行
She thinks Andrew Earlham records his attacks.

351
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,000
他把东西藏在了某个地方
That he's storing them somewhere.

352
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,400
厄拉姆昨晚出现在了她家外面
Earlham turned up outside her house last night.

353
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,510
他发现了她正在调查他
He found out she's been looking into him.

354
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,890
我知道
I know.

355
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,740
因为你告诉他的  为什么
Because you told him? Why?

356
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,830
我们要让安德鲁坐立不安  愤怒
We need Andrew unsettled. Angry.

357
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,720
那样他就会犯错  我们就可以把他绳之以法
That's when he'll make mistakes, that's when we'll catch him.

358
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,660
别担心  我们在劳拉住的地方安排了巡逻车
Don't worry, we had a squad car on Laura's place.

359
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,620
你不应该让她掺和进来的
You shouldn't put her in the middle of this.

360
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,170
是她自己掺和进来的
She put herself in the middle.

361
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,240
我只是抓住了机会给安德鲁施压
I just took the opportunity to push Andrew.

362
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,590
-抱歉  我知道我没发言权  -你当然有
- I'm sorry, I know this isn't my place, but - Course it is.

363
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,050
这项行动多亏了你
This operation is down to you.

364
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,950
我只是希望能有更多证据上报
I just wish we had more to report.

365
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,750
-但今晚我要去他家吃完饭  -今晚
- But tonight I'm going for dinner at his place. - Tonight?

366
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,580
美妙周五夜  是吧
Great Friday night, huh

367
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,870
记住  别让自己有机可乘
Remember, don't make yourself too available.

368
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:05,880
我看过资料了
I've read the profile.

369
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,420
-我只是提醒你  因为...  -我知道
- I'm only saying because... - Look, I know

370
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,500
等着批准通过很让人泄气
how frustrating it's been waiting for approval to come through

371
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,320
但我们成功在望了  有点信心
but we're close now. Just keep the faith.

372
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,750
好的
Ok.

373
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,460
-谢谢  警探  -没事
- Thanks, Detective. - Of course.

374
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,710
-马上就好  -我们需要你去五号检查室
- Yep, just a minute. - OK, we need you in Exam 5.

375
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,080
我能先从柜子里拿点东西出来吗
Can I grab something from my locker?

376
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,970
没时间了  他们早就在等着了
There isn't much time. They've been waiting already.

377
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,500
好吧  咱们去把这个处理完
All right, then, let's get this over with.

378
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,840
很高兴你给我打了电话
I'm glad you called.

379
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,210
我们好久都没联系了
It's been a long time.

380
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,090
是啊
Yeah.

381
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,220
给你
Er, here.

382
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,220
安德鲁的手机
Andrew's phone.

383
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,020
谢谢
Thank you.

384
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,210
我会为你做任何事  你知道的
I'd do anything for you, you know that.

385
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,610
虽然你还在生我的气
Even when you're angry at me.

386
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,760
我猜你也不会告诉我要这手机干什么
I don't suppose you're gonna tell me what that's for?

387
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,950
-你最好不要知道  -不要知道
- It's probably best that you don't know. - Don't know.

388
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,300
没事
Ok.

389
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,560
我以为你已经释怀了  劳拉
I thought you were moving on with your life, Laura.

390
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,310
-我必须这么做  -不  你不需要
- I have to do this. - No, you don't.

391
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,900
你从来都不需要做这些事
You never had to do any of it.

392
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,250
你经历了噩梦般的事  你一直想纠正
You had a terrible thing happen to you and you tried to fix it.

393
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,560
而不是给自己点时间来恢复
Instead of taking time to get better and look after yourself.

394
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,650
我很想你
I miss you.

395
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,360
我也想你
I miss you, too.

396
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,100
你觉得你会停止恨我吗
Do you think you'll ever stop hating me?

397
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,970
我并不恨你  凯蒂
I don't hate you, Katy.

398
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,910
我只是...我没法再相信你了
I just... I can't trust you.

399
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,720
我也不知道要怎么面对你
And I don't know how to be around you.

400
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,940
好吧...
Well...

401
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,210
等你准备好了
when you are ready...

402
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,860
...你知道我在哪
..You know where I am.

403
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,410
-快请进  -你好
- Hi, come in, come in. - Hey.

404
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,180
-谢谢  -就挂这吧
- Thanks. - There you go. Thank you.

405
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:07,900
你真美
Wow, you look amazing.

406
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,640
-从这里过去就好  -赞
- Just through here. - Great.

407
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,800
-挺香的啊  -谢谢夸奖
- That smells good. - Thank you.

408
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,460
也没什么特别  就是一些专门订购的食材
It's nothing much, just er, speciality-ordered ingredients

409
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,220
还为此准备了两天
and about 48 hours of preparation.

410
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,820
-我很高兴你能来  -为何不来
- I'm glad you came. - Why wouldn't I?

411
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,480
今天有人从我柜子里拿走了我的手机
Someone took my phone from a locker today.

412
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,860
-真烦人  -没事  我把那个号取消了
- That's annoying. - No, it's fine, it's been cancelled,

413
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,460
我订了另一支手机
and there's another one ordered.

414
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,580
你懂的  没了手机就好像成了孩子
You know how it is - you lose your phone, you feel like a child.

415
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,560
不能发短信取消或修改时间
How did we ever make social arrangements

416
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,000
那我们要怎么约人
when we couldn't cancel or change with a text last-minute?

417
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,970
我只要答应了就会出现
Well, I like to turn up when I've agreed to.

418
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,560
我就是那么老套
I'm old-fashioned like that.

419
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,470
我也是
Me, too.

420
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,810
来点酒吗  女士
Drink, m'lady?

421
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,970
好啊  听起来不错
Yeah. Sounds good.

422
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:11,540
-你这地方挺不错的  -谢谢  还行吧
- I like your place. - Thanks. It's OK.

423
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:15,390
我一直想买些画挂墙上  你知道吗
Keep meaning to buy some more art to put on the walls, you know?

424
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:19,040
其实我上周买到了心仪的  是个本地的艺术家
I found something last week, actually. A local artist.

425
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,990
就在隔壁房的墙上  你有兴趣可以去看看
It's on the wall in the other room, if you fancy.

426
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
当然
Sure.

427
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,850
冒昧问一下
Forgive me for asking. Er...

428
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,540
你还好吗
Are you okay?

429
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,760
-当然  怎么了  -我不知道
- Of course. Why? - Oh, I don't know.

430
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,420
你...你有点不自在
You just... You seem tense.

431
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,180
有点累吧
Long day.

432
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,140
那我正好有你需要的东西
Then I have just the thing for you.

433
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,450
-干杯  -干杯
- Cheers. - Cheers.

434
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:34,750
抱歉  我能要杯水吗  今天有点脱水
Sorry, could I get a glass of water? I'm a bit dehydrated today.

435
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,760
我不想让你误会
I don't want to start off on the wrong foot.

436
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,060
没事  我马上来
Yes, yes, of course. I'll be right back.

437
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,930
-给你  -谢谢
- There you go. - Thanks.

438
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,700
这画真不错  作者叫什么
It's a nice piece. What's the artist's name?

439
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,560
你包里的是什么  夏洛特
What's in your bag, Charlotte?

440
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,080
你什么意思
What do you mean?

441
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,570
我看到你了
I saw you.

442
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:42,510
你看到我干什么  我不太懂
You saw me what? I don't understand.

443
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,820
你用注射器抽取了红酒
You filled a syringe from your glass.

444
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,060
然后
And then...

445
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,490
我猜  你会编借口吧
You'll be making your excuses, I imagine.

446
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,460
一个紧急电话打来  然后你要先离开
An urgent phone call that meant you just had to leave

447
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,500
或者忽然头很痛  然后...
or a sudden headache and then...

448
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,160
然后干什么呢
and then what?

449
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:02,980
把这珍贵的样本送去警察实验室吗
Take your precious sample down to the police lab?

450
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,060
是这样吗
Is that about the size of it?

451
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,180
夏洛特
Charlotte?

452
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,640
让开
Step away.

453
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,310
为什么
Why?

454
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,700
你觉得我会对你做什么
What is it you think I'm gonna do to you?

455
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,450
我可以立刻叫来后援
I can have back-up here in seconds.

456
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,080
我可没阻止你离开
Well, I'm not stopping you from leaving.

457
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,010
你的实验室不会发现任何东西的
Your lab's not gonna find anything.

458
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:38,590
我给你倒了杯红酒  仅此而已
I poured you a glass of wine. And that's it.

459
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,150
真是可惜
It's a shame, really.

460
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,070
我们本可以很开心的
We'd have had fun.

461
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,370
我知道的
I know it.

462
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,700
该死  该死
Shit. Shit.

463
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,720
该死
Shit!

464
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,110
那么  这是什么原理
So, how does this work?

465
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,420
说实话  不知道
Honestly, no idea.

466
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,680
我技术小组的一个朋友给了我程序
A friend of mine from the tech squad just gave me the programme.

467
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:44,120
那你为什么要拿他的手机  为什么是现在
So, why did you take his phone, why now?

468
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,560
我觉得...
I think that erm...

469
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:50,310
当他强奸女人时候他会拍下来
when he rapes women he films it.

470
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,850
-你怎么知道的  -他说了一些话
- How do you know? - Something he said.

471
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,490
变态混蛋
Sick bastard.

472
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,690
我有机会的时候就该砸烂他的脸
I should've smashed his face in when I had the chance.

473
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,930
无论他把文件藏哪  都不在他家里
Wherever he keeps the files, they're not in his house,

474
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,890
也不在他的电脑和手机里
they're not on his computer or his phone,

475
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,890
警察肯定在哈蒙警长控告之后搜过了
the police would have searched after DI Harmon's charge.

476
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:09,200
所以如果他有记录  多半在其他地方
So if he keeps recordings, they're offsite?

477
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,390
他这种人  肯定会很小心
Someone like him, he will be careful.

478
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,190
会有很多要梳理的东西
There'll be a lot to get through.

479
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,210
我可以把手机的内容传到电脑上
I could dump the contents of the phone onto the laptop.

480
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:18,080
-我们可以一起看  -我知道我不该请你帮忙
- we can both look. - I know I shouldn't be asking you for help, it's...

481
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,680
上次就是因为帮助我才让你变成现在这样
helping me last time that got you into this situation.

482
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,770
别  是安德鲁最终害我丢了工作
Nah, Andrew was the one who made sure I lost my job.

483
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,860
好吧  那么...
Right. Well...

484
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,540
好  感谢你打电话来
OK. Thanks for calling.

485
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,310
行动不顺利
The op went badly.

486
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,810
针对安德鲁·厄拉姆的卧底行动
The undercover with Andrew Earlham.

487
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,220
有多遭
How bad?

488
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,980
天啊  没事的  我们会找到其他办法
Jesus. It's OK, we're gonna find another way.

489
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,320
怎么找
How?

490
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,990
他逃脱了上一个指控
He walked away from the last accusation.

491
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:58,710
现在是你  还需要多少人才能阻止他
And now you. How many more until somebody stops him?

492
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,530
我们在尽力  我是说  罗里
We're doing our best. I mean, Rory...

493
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:04,230
-整个团队  所有人  -显然还不够好
- the whole team, everybody. - Well, it's not good enough.

494
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,300
他在我们家里袭击了你  他需要面对后果
He attacked you in our house. He needs to face the consequences.

495
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,230
-冷静  珍  -我不能  这事...
- Calm down, Jen. - I can't. It's...

496
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,280
我知道事情发生在你身上而不是我
I know this happened to you and not me,

497
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,170
但我感觉保护你是我的职责
but I feel like it's my job to protect you,

498
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:19,450
-而我却没在  -请不要这么说  不要
- and I wasn't there. - Please don't say that. You mustn't.

499
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,850
珍
Jen.

500
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,190
安德鲁有没有提到过一个叫
Did Andrew ever mention anybody called...

501
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:32,610
-米娅·兰斯夫卡的人  -没有  怎么了
- Mia Lentzovka? - No. Why?

502
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:35,730
不知道呢  这里有个几天前的消息
Dunno. There's a text message from a few days ago.

503
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,280
所以警察肯定没看到
So the cops wouldn't have seen it.

504
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,800
「你什么时候能来拿你的东西」
"When can you come over to collect your things?"

505
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,260
有这个女人的地址吗
Is there an address for this woman?

506
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:48,410
-有  在联络簿里  -太好了  谢谢你
- Yeah, it's in the contacts. - Brilliant. Thank you.

507
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,100
好了  我要给凡妮莎打电话
Right. I'm gonna call Vanessa.

508
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,630
我希望这能有用
I hope it's useful.

509
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,370
谢谢
Thanks.

510
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,310
我真的很抱歉
I really am sorry.

511
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,100
关于我和凯蒂的事
About me and Katy.

512
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,520
我知道  我也是
I know. Me too.

513
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,180
谢谢你帮我
Thanks for helping me.

514
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,790
「你好  我是凡妮莎·哈蒙
'Hi, this is a Vanessa Harmon.

515
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,120
我现在不在  请留言」
I'm not around right now, so leave a message.

516
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,450
你好
Hello.

517
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,460
需要帮助吗
Can I help you?

518
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,450
你好  我是...
Hi, I'm a...

519
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,880
安德鲁的朋友
a friend of Andrew's.

520
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,300
安德鲁·厄拉姆
Andrew Earlham.

521
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,940
-他没事吧  -挺好的  他没事
- Is he all right? - Fine. Yeah, yeah, fine.

522
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,170
你是米娅吗
Erm, are you Mia?

523
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,350
是的  是我
Yes. I am.

524
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,980
我是劳拉
I'm Laura.

525
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,620
实际上  我能进去聊几分钟吗
Actually, is it all right if I come in for a minute?

526
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,900
谢谢
Thanks.

527
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,380
西尔维娅
Sylvia?

528
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,180
这是安德鲁的朋友  劳拉
This is a friend of Andrew's. Laura.

529
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,790
你好  亲爱的
Hello, dear.

530
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,120
能有访客真好
How nice to have a visitor.

531
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,830
安德鲁从来不带客人来  是吧  米娅
Andrew never brings visitors here, does he, Mia?

532
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,590
-从来没  -安德鲁叫我来帮他取东西
- No, never. - Andrew asked me to pick something up for him.

533
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,840
他有东西存在这里吗
He's got some stuff stored here?

534
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,600
他本应该几天前来拿的
He was supposed to collect it a few days ago.

535
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,300
是的
Yes.

536
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,910
是的  当然
Yes, of course.

537
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,690
请跟我来
Please, follow me.

538
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,140
谢谢
Thanks.

539
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,940
请吧
Here you go.

540
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,720
谢谢  我会尽量快点
Thanks. I'll try and be quick.

541
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,940
喂  我是米娅
Hello. It's Mia.

542
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,290
-你找到了吗  你有没有...  -有  谢谢
- Do you have everything? Did you find - Yes, thanks.

543
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,420
我得走了  谢谢你们
I've got to run. Thank you.

544
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,820
{\an9}凡妮莎

545
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,540
-她在里边很生气  -好吧
- She's pretty upset in there. - OK.

546
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,940
-天啊  终于  -真抱歉
- Oh, God. Finally. - I'm sorry.

547
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,590
我没值班  我得走程序进来
I wasn't on duty. I had to get in.

548
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,260
我给凡妮莎打电话却直接进语音信息了
I called Vanessa but her phone goes straight to voicemail.

549
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:56,530
我还以为有了这发现  你们会行动快一些
You'd think people would move quicker after what I found.

550
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,700
前台告诉我录像的事了
