00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,580
都是灰尘
It's dusty.

42
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,200
只有热风
Just hot air.

43
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,200
什么
What?

44
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,680
你还好吗
You okay?

45
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,100
还行  几点了
Yeah. What time is it?

46
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,150
九点四十
Nine forty.

47
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,940
你渴吗
Are you thirsty?

48
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,910
我们刚刚不应该休息的  都怪我  抱歉
We shouldn't have stopped. It's my fault. I'm sorry.

49
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,190
我经常想着  我有一天会去那里的
Like I said, I just always thought I'd go there someday,

50
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,570
所以就可能像...
so it seemed like maybe a...

51
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,950
没关系
It's okay.

52
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,630
我们还有时间
We have time.

53
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,770
你电话设置好了吗
You have the phone ready?

54
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,110
我小时候经常跟我爸去兰堡球场看比赛
My dad and I used to go to games at Lambeau when I was little.

55
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,010
绿湾包装工队是橄榄球联盟里
You know, the Packers are the only

56
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,870
唯一一支由公众共同拥有的球队
community-owned team in the NFL.

57
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,180
1984年的时候  教士队的老板
Well, the owner of the Padres

58
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,820
也想要资助这球队
tried to donate the team

59
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,710
去代表美国圣迭戈市
to the city of San Diego in 1984,

60
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,060
但法律不允许
but the league wouldn't allow it.

61
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,310
系统阻止了
The system prevented it.

62
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,220
电话设置好了没
You have the phone ready?

63
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,420
搞定了  我预留了60秒
Yeah, I gave it 60 seconds before it goes,

64
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,340
在电话之后
you know, after the call arms it.

65
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,610
兄弟  介意我进去吗
Hey, um, mind if I come in?

66
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,310
-进来  -嗯
- Come in? - Yeah.

67
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,870
别  我在忙呢
Yeah, no, I'm working.

68
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,520
或许你可以休息一下
Maybe take a break just for a minute.

69
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,740
我们可没有时间休息
We don't have a minute.

70
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,160
你刚刚才说我们还有时间
You said we have time.

71
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,320
如果我们不休息的话
Not if we take a break.

72
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,580
-我要进来了  -不要啊
- I'm coming in. - No!

73
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,190
-我的天  你小心点  -进来能让我安心点  好吗
- Oh, Jesus, be careful! - Look, it'll relax me, okay?

74
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,250
只是
Just...

75
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,090
出去
Get out.

76
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,700
你知道这有多精细吗
Do you know how delicate this is?

77
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,970
当然知道
Of course.

78
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,750
你想把我们俩都害死吗
You wanna get us both killed?

79
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,060
我会很小心的
Look, I'll be careful.

80
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,440
这里面更热了
It's even hotter in here.

81
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,880
抱歉我没能修好那空调
Sorry I couldn't get the AC going.

82
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,020
所以我们要怎么处理这帐篷
So what do we do with the tent?

83
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,880
等我们完事之后
I mean, when we're done.

84
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,540
-烧了吗  -为什么要烧掉
- Burn it? - Why would we burn it?

85
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,730
有我们的基因  证据
DNA. Evidence.

86
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,250
所以我们才在里面弄  不是吗
That's why we're in here, right?

87
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,940
-可以洗啊  -对
- A tent can be washed. - Right.

88
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,740
可如果他们在我们到达目的地前
What if they check the bag, you know,

89
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,090
要检查这包呢
before we get to the spot?

90
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,320
-坚持我们的说法  -好
- Stick to the story. - Right.

91
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,160
-简单明了  -对
- Short and simple. - Right.

92
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,920
-就两句话  还记得吗  -记得
- Two sentences, remember? - Yes.

93
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,120
会没事的
You'll be fine.

94
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,040
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

95
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,360
抱歉
Sorry.

96
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,360
我只是
I just...

97
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,300
都这时候了  这也不重要了吧
I mean, at this point, what does it matter?

98
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,600
跟我说说那支队伍
Tell me about the Packers.

99
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,840
你去看的第一场比赛
First game you went to.

100
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,600
你不用转移我的注意力
Oh, you don't have to Jedi mind trick me.

101
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,650
我没事
I'm fine.

102
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,280
那时我八岁
I was eight.

103
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,100
我本来都不知道  但历史上
And I didn't realize it then, but historically,

104
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,690
那场确实是关键赛
it was a really significant game.

105
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,870
你听说过兰博之跃[一种庆祝方式]吗
Have you ever heard of the Lambeau Leap?

106
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,830
瑞吉·怀特从对方获得进攻者的漏球
R-Reggie White recovered a fumble from the Raiders

107
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,920
然后横向传给了勒鲁瓦·巴特勒
and he lateraled it to LeRoy Butler

108
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,070
由他带球跑到25码触地得分
who took it in 25 yards for the touchdown.

109
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,860
为了庆祝  他跳进了看台的第一排
And to celebrate, he jumped into the first row of stands

110
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,520
一大群粉丝
and a bunch of the fans,

111
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,340
有老有少
I mean, old men, grown men,

112
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,790
他们跟他拥抱然后拍拍他的背
they just hugged him and patted him on the back.

113
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,070
兰博之跃
The Lambeau Leap.

114
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,230
这大概是他们第一次
Probably the first time

115
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,310
与黑人接触
any of them had ever touched a black man...

116
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,180
也包括我父亲在内
my dad included.

117
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,010
如果他没有赢呢
What if he doesn't win?

118
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,620
我要吐了
I'm gonna throw up.

119
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,010
喝点水吧
Drink some water.

120
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,460
我快弄完了
I'm almost done.

121
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,890
你还好吗
You okay?

122
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,760
我可以把电视打开吗
Mind if I turn on the TV?

123
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,090
你想看就打开吧
If it makes you feel better, go ahead.

124
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,070
...记者正在会议中心...
...our correspondent is live at the convention center...

125
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,780
真的吗
Really?

126
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,540
来了很多人...
There's a big crowd...

127
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,770
不能换个台吗
You can't do better than this?

128
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,840
你换好衣服了吗
You getting dressed?

129
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,190
你先洗个澡吧  一身臭汗
You might wanna shower first. It's like a swamp in here.

130
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,360
今晚史密斯成为代表
Gonna be a wild one

131
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,400
场面一定会非常壮观
down there tonight as Smith works the delegates...

132
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,440
支持者认为今晚能有和他交流的机会
Supporters believe tonight is the chance to talk to his base,

133
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,260
实际上  今晚他将着力
but the truth is tonight should be all about

134
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,690
说服大家他能胜任总统这份职务
convincing people that he can do the job and be presidential.

135
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,790
人们能想象到他在白宫的场景吗
Can people picture him in the White House?

136
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,110
这正是问题所在
That's the question.

137
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,850
他的话能引起拿不定主意的选民的共鸣吗
Will his message resonate with undecided voters?

138
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,090
今晚聚光灯将给他大约一小时的时间
The spotlight will be on him tonight for about an hour

139
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,750
展现自己说服大家
to see if, you know, he can accomplish just that.

140
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,950
也有些好消息  迈克
There's some good points here, Michael.

141
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,070
绝对是这一周的压轴好戏
Definitely a big finale to a long week.

142
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,920
我们有必要知道每一次大会都是
I think it's important to know that each convention

143
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,350
独一无二的
has its own story to tell,

144
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,210
{\an8}我做不到  对不起

145
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,930
从开幕敲槌到最后的掉球仪式
from the opening gavel to the final balloon drop.

146
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,880
-操  -他们想赋予大会
- Fuck! - They're trying to create the narrative

147
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,230
人的性格
of conventions as people.

148
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,200
而这里的选民
What's happening here is that

149
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,400
投票结果是无法预测的
people are proving to be unpredictable in the polling.

150
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,490
...他生命中最关键的一次演讲
...is one of the most critical speeches of his life.

151
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,510
一名代表说大多数选民
One delegate told me a considerable portion of the electorate

152
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,550
并不看好他有当总统的能力
simply did not see him as presidential.

153
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,780
他得向众人展示
His challenge is to reveal himself

154
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,650
他可以领导整个国家的气魄
as someone who can lead a nation.

155
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,780
他没法满足所有人的要求
He cannot be all things to all people,

156
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,300
但他得说服这几百万选民
but his task will be to convince millions

157
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,660
他能胜任总统这份职务
that he's up for the job.

158
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,100
有人担心会有人
There's been some concern that if someone

159
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,060
想要发言或采取行动
wanted to make a statement or do something,

160
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,110
今天正是行动的好时机
that today might be that day,

161
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,970
所以现场安排了很多警卫人员
so we are seeing a lot of police presence.

162
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,090
这绝对符合他的最大利益
It's definitely in his best interest to.

163
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,240
-同意  不过... -我靠
- I agree, but... - Holy shit!

164
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,220
天呐
Oh, my God.

165
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,250
-抱歉  -搞什么
- I'm so sorry. - What the hell?!

166
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,810
那个服务员让我进来的
The maid let me in.

167
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,750
只有他能修好
He's the only one who can fix it.

168
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,880
我们敲了门
We knocked,

169
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,660
但电视太...
but this TV is so...

170
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,490
他有太多事情...
He's had a lot of things on his...

171
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,260
你可以一会再过来吗
Could you just come back later?

172
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,220
我不是故意吓你的
Um, I didn't mean to alarm you.

173
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,320
我一分钟就能做好
I'll be done in a minute here.

174
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,710
最后一个了  弄好我就走了
It's my last one, and then I can get out of your hair.

175
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,570
直接回家
Go home.

176
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,280
抱歉没有早点来  但今天人手不足
I'm sorry we couldn't come sooner, but we're a man short today.

177
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,570
其实我打算出门了
I'm actually on my way out.

178
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,710
你能给我十分钟收拾行李吗
Could you give me 10 minutes to pack up my stuff?

179
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,480
十分钟吗  我五分钟就弄好了
Uh, 10 minutes? I'll be done in five.

180
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,830
-我赶时间  -好吧
- I'm running late. - Well,

181
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,240
我不影响你  你快收拾吧
don't let me stop you. Do what you gotta do.

182
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,410
现在做这个是不是有点晚了
Isn't it a little late for this?

183
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,480
有点  抱歉
Yeah, it is. Sorry about that.

184
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,020
今天真够疯狂的
It's been a crazy day.

185
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,740
因为这个会议市中心堵死了
Traffic in the city is a mess with this convention in town.

186
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,680
平时的路这会儿有三倍堵
I had to drive through the thick of it three times already.

187
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
因纳贝特只剩一条小路可走
Innerbelt's down to one lane

188
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,480
希望路就更不用说了
and you can forget about Prospect.

189
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,140
我以为总算经过了堵的地段
I finally think I got a hold on all these road closures

190
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,920
结果到了这里又遇上了堵塞
and come out here and hit another massive jam.

191
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,120
一帮小孩们吵着抗议
Bunch of rowdy kids protesting,

192
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,350
把街上堵得水泄不通
getting into the street, messing up traffic.

193
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,740
老实跟你说
Look, if I'm being honest with you,

194
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,870
我马上要结束今天十二个小时的工作了
I'm at the tail end of a 12-hour day,

195
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,400
我很想快点回家
I would just love to get home

196
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,750
陪我老婆看完演讲
and see the rest of that speech with my wife.

197
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,240
请快点
Please hurry.

198
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,790
谢谢你
I do appreciate it.

199
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,750
不管怎么样
Anyway,

200
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,630
真不知道你怎么能忍受这种温度的
don't know how you could take this heat a minute longer.

201
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,030
你是进城来开会的吗
You in town for the convention?

202
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,420
我看到你的东西了
I saw your, uh, thingy over there.

203
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,300
是的
Oh, uh, yeah.

204
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,810
我...我是进城来开会的
Yeah, I'm, uh, in town for the convention, yes.

205
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,650
看来你要迟到了
Well, I guess you are running late.

206
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,410
我保证我马上就弄好
I'll have this done in a minute, I promise.

207
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,560
我有原则  不和房客讨论政策
I kind of have a rule not to discuss politics with the customers,

208
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,030
但我想你在电视上应该都看到了
but I figured you got it on the TV, so.

209
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,420
是啊  显而易见的事
Yeah, elephant in the room, so to speak.

210
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,050
是啊  的确很明显
Yeah, he's some kind of elephant, that's for sure.

211
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,320
很难忽视
Tough to ignore.

212
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,870
你是这个意思吗
Is that what you mean?

213
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,230
-是的  -是啊
- Yeah. - Yeah? Well...

214
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,610
他的人气真的很高  对吧
He really gets the juices flowing, you know?

215
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,100
你不是代表吧
You're not a delegate, are you?

216
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,060
不然的话  你现在肯定在会场
I mean, if you were, you'd be in that arena right now, right?

217
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,920
我只是要去参加会后的酒会
I'm just going to the after party.

218
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,260
真不错
Oh, very nice.

219
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,950
-是什么大人物吗  -不
- Some kind of big shot? - No.

220
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,250
我明白
I hear ya.

221
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,260
朋友的朋友是个大人物  对吧
Friend of a friend of a big shot, am I right?

222
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,370
正如我所说
Yeah, like I said,

223
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,370
我一般不和房客讨论政治
I usually don't talk politics with customers,

224
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,220
但这几天城里的人嘴里说的都是这些
but it's all anybody wants to talk about in this town these days.

225
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,960
政治和体育
Politics and sports.

226
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,840
我们就不能直接投给勒布朗·詹姆斯吗
I mean, can't we just vote for LeBron James?

227
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,570
我不是同性恋  但是
I'm not gay, but, boy,

228
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,710
要是勒布朗说要我嫁给他
I'd have to give it some serious consideration

229
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,690
我会考虑一下
if LeBron asked me to marry him.

230
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,490
我可能的好好考虑
I might have to rethink

231
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,550
我当初在同性恋婚姻提案中的立场了
my whole position on that gay marriage thing.

232
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,480
当然了  我只是在开玩笑的
I'm just kidding, of course.

233
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,700
挺好笑的
That's funny.

234
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,640
这里真是热得像地狱一样
Hot as the devil in here.

235
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,040
是啊
Yeah.

236
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,140
你的小家伙呢
Where's your little one?

237
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,620
小家伙
Little one?

238
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,860
我的孩子小时候
When my boys were young,

239
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,720
就喜欢在客厅搭堡垒
they used to build forts in the living room,

240
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,330
一般都用毯子和被子
usually with blankets and sheets.

241
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,500
不过好像没用过真正的帐篷
Can't say they ever used an actual tent, though.

242
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,620
是啊  不  我们带他去野营后
Yeah, no, um, ever since we took him camping,

243
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,870
他就喜欢上了
he's been obsessed with it.

244
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,840
客厅啊  后院啊  屋顶啊
You know, living room, backyard, roof.

245
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,580
我都习惯了  到处都是
I'm so accustomed to seeing it around,

246
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,260
我自己几乎都没注意
I barely even notice it anymore.

247
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,030
-他几岁  -七岁
- How old is he? - Seven.

248
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,190
真的吗
Really?

249
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,120
你看上去很年轻啊
You seem so young.

250
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,430
结婚早吧
Started early, I guess.

251
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,380
是啊  我的是18岁和22岁
Yeah, well, mine are 18 and 22.

252
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,150
疯狂的小混蛋
Yeah, crazy, little bastards.

253
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,560
当然了  他们已经不小了
Of course, they're not so little anymore,

254
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,160
所以我想他们只是疯狂的混蛋
so I guess they're just crazy bastards now.

255
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,130
柯蒂斯  我的长子  他上大学了
Curtis, my older one, he goes to college.

256
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,550
他读的是个娘娘腔的专业  上帝啊
He's a women's studies major, God help us.

257
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,700
小儿子还在念高中
The younger one, he's still in high school.

258
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,470
他是州篮球队队员
He's a basketball player, all-state.

259
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,940
说实话  他们都是好孩子
Well, truth be told, they're both great kids.

260
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,710
总会让你不禁想
You know, really gets you thinking

261
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,700
他们离开后会怎么样
when they leave the house, I'll tell you that.

262
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,770
不知道他们会变成什么样
Just don't know how they're gonna turn out.

263
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,680
只能尽力防守
Just do your best and let 'em go,

264
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,720
交叉手指
cross your fingers.

265
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,660
你说你的小孩在哪里来着
Where'd you say your boy was?

266
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,110
和我妻子一起在家里
At home with my wife.

267
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,660
对
Right, um,

268
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,930
我知道这看起来很奇怪
I know it looks weird,

269
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,810
但我喜欢出差的时候带上
but I like to bring it with me when I travel.

270
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,190
能缓解对他的四年
It makes me miss him less.

271
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,300
那...那不错
That's-- that's sweet.

272
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,540
-怎么样了  -过几分钟...
- How's it going? - A few more minutes and...

273
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,150
就修好走人
I'll be out of your way.

274
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,470
好
Great.

275
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,040
你要来点吗
You want some?

276
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,790
算了吧
I better not.

277
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,100
不过谢了
Thanks, though.

278
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,230
你觉得他能赢吗
You think he can win?

279
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,560
他都走到了今天
He's made it this far.

280
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,660
是啊
Yeah.

281
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,620
不知道这个国家有没有准备好接受如此真实的领导
I just wonder if this country's ready for someone so real.

282
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,540
但是到了十一月  我会给他投票
But come November, he's got my vote.

283
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,500
真不错
Good to hear.

284
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,080
移民  北美自由贸易协定  中东的这些乱子
Immigration, NAFTA, the whole mess in the Middle East.

285
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,670
你们这些人讲得都是有模有样的
Oh, your guy really tells it like it is.

286
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,660
我们这些人
My guy?

287
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,550
不过我告诉你
I'll tell you what, though.

288
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,340
不管谁赢了  街上都会
Whoever wins, there's gonna be

289
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,830
有一大群气坏了的家伙
an army of pissed off people roaming in the streets.

290
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,790
上帝啊
Fucking Christ!

291
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,170
你能小心点嘛
Careful, would ya?!

292
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,840
对不起
I'm sorry.

293
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,960
不
No, um,

294
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,010
我...我反应过度了
I just-- I overreacted.

295
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,340
对不起
I'm sorry.

296
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,260
没事
Ah, it's-- it's okay.

297
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,890
我也有紧张的时候
I'd be on edge, too.

298
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,270
今晚对你来说很重要
It's a big night for you.

299
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,580
我修好后  马上就走
I'll just finish up here and then I'll-- I'll be on my way.

300
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,220
还愿意给我酒吗
That offer still stand?

301
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,740
我也不想那么说  但我有点洁癖
Ah, I hate to be that guy, but I'm kind of a germ freak.

302
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,040
能给我搞个杯子吗
Think you could get me a cup?

303
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,220
好的
Sure.

304
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,730
给
Ah, here you go!

305
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,210
给
Here you go.

306
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,740
这一天真是漫长
It's been a long day.

307
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,630
真不错
Oh, nice.

308
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,120
味道真不错  谢谢
That is very nice. Thank you.

309
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,630
小波本威士忌
Small batch bourbon.

310
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,970
是我一个朋友在肯塔基制的
A friend of mine distills it in Kentucky

311
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,200
然后100一瓶卖给布鲁克林的嬉皮士
and sells it to hipsters in Brooklyn for $100 a bottle.

312
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,650
一百
A hundred bucks?

313
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,780
看来各有所爱了
Wow, everybody's got an angle, I guess.

314
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,740
不是吗
Don't they?

315
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,810
不好意思
Excuse me.

316
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,330
没事吧
Everything okay in there?

317
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,670
没事  马上就好
Yeah, just, uh, give me a second.

318
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,120
-LG的一次性电话吧  -是的
- An LG burner, am I right? - Yep.

319
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,830
我干过几年手机修理
Yeah, I spent a few years in phone repair.

320
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,010
要给我看看吗
Want me to have a look?

321
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,190
不用
No.

322
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,970
你确定吗
You sure?

323
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,120
好了
There you go.

324
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,960
一切都没事吧
Everything okay?

325
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,470
如果你有一台时光机
If you had a time machine...

326
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,830
你能回到过去
and you could go back in time

327
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,260
阻止希特勒变成希特勒...
and prevent Hitler from becoming Hitler...

328
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,160
你会去的  对吗
you have to do it, right?

329
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,680
时光机
A time machine?

330
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,600
是啊  就像《回到未来》
Yeah, like "Back to the Future."

331
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,490
德洛雷安
A DeLorean.

332
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,360
每小时88.8英里  你就能回到过去
88.8 miles per hour, you can go back in time,

333
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,350
你能回到1930年的德国
specifically, you go back to Germany circa 1930,

334
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,210
你和希特勒在一个城市
you're in the same city as Hitler,

335
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,840
一个房间  你有一把枪
same room, you have a gun.

336
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,320
你会动手吗
Do you do it?

337
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,480
会吧
Yeah.

338
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,070
-我想我会的  -你会吗
- I guess I would. - You would?

339
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,350
是啊
Yeah.

340
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,690
我是说  谋杀的确是没啥
I mean, murder is murder.

341
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,020
的确是一种罪
It'd still be a sin, I suppose,

342
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,500
但那好像是正义的
but that one would seem justifiable.

343
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,740
我想我会有那个勇气
I'd like to think I'd have the guts to do it.

344
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,690
对
Right.

345
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,760
不过要是那个时光机坏了
Get pretty sticky, though,

346
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,810
那可就难办了
if that time machine broke down.

347
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,740
我是说  你杀了希特勒后
I mean, after you killed Hitler.

348
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,710
肯定很难跟在场的那些人解释
It'd be a tough one to explain to the folks in the moment.

349
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,370
"相信我  伙计们  他会做一些坏事"
"Believe me, people, he was gonna do some bad things."

350
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,030
我觉得值得做出牺牲
I think it'd be worth the sacrifice,

351
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,050
想到自己阻止了大屠杀
knowing you prevented the Holocaust.

352
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,500
晚上也能安心入睡
I could sleep at night.

353
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,260
但谁知道会不会有第二个希特勒呢
But who's to say another Hitler wouldn't be waiting in the wings?

354
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,000
另一场大逃杀
You know, a different Holocaust?

355
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,880
只靠一个人是无法杀死两百万犹太人
I mean, one person alone didn't kill two million Jews.

356
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,530
-六百万  -那更加说明我的观点了
- Six million. - Okay, more to my point.

357
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,520
我们算是帮助这个人
So we somehow associate this one man

358
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,320
造成这么多人死亡
with all these millions of deaths...

359
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,710
-是谋杀  -但不是他扣下的扳机
- Murders. - ...but he wasn't the one pulling the triggers.

360
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,280
对吧  不是他扔下的炸弹
Right? He wasn't the one dropping the bombs.

361
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,630
我不知道
Eh, I don't know.

362
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,710
我现在重新考虑  也许我不会动手
I'm rethinking this now. Maybe I wouldn't.

363
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,610
-你不会  -是的
- You wouldn't? - No.

364
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,410
你是说你选择不干掉那个
So you're saying you wouldn't take out the person

365
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,160
策划战争夺走
who devised and implemented the destruction

366
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,110
一千一百万人生命的人
of 11 million human lives?

367
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,780
你刚刚说六百万
You said six million.

368
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,920
六百万犹太人  五百万其他人
Six million Jews, five million others.

369
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,220
如果我知道那样做能阻止这些屠杀
Well, if I knew that it would prevent those deaths,

370
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,080
那当然了  但我要说的是万一不能呢
then, yeah, sure, but what I'm saying is what if it didn't?

371
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,780
但是  嘴上说
And anyway, it's easy to say,

372
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,380
"如果我见到希特勒  我会..."很简单
"If I could've met Hitler, I would've..." Blah, blah, blah,

373
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,390
但没人做到过
but nobody ever did.

374
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,680
所以说明很多人肯定同意他的做法
So that means a whole lot of people must've agreed with him.

375
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,260
你觉得是吗
You think so?

376
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,630
也许他们也恨犹太人
Maybe they hated the Jews, too.

377
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,970
足够杀死六百万人吗
Enough to kill six million of them?

378
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,860
足够接受这件事
Enough to go along with it.

379
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,150
我不知道  他们在那个年代可能就会那样
I don't know, could be they were living in hateful times.

380
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,780
对
Right.

381
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,170
我说了  回头想想
Like I said, it's easy to look back

382
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,480
说自己会更好  是很简单的事
and say you would've been better.

383
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,400
-我们会拒绝  -没错
- That we'd resist. - Yeah.

384
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,140
-我们会做些什么  -是的
- That we'd do something. - Sure.

385
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,460
问题是  我们没有时光机  不是吗
Thing is, we don't have a time machine, do we?

386
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,610
你没看到我的德洛雷安停车在外面吗
You didn't see my DeLorean parked out front?

387
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,160
不好意思
Sorry.

388
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,760
是我妻子  我得接一下
Uh, it's my wife. I have to take this.

389
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,080
我真的快修好了  我马上回来
I really am almost done. I'll-- I'll be right back.

390
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,880
亲爱的
Hey, honey.

391
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:17,340
{\an8}会议入场证
金色权限

392
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,400
看上不真不错
Whoa, looking sharp!

393
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,270
我该走了  你可以待在这里修好空调
I should really get going, but feel free to stay and finish up.

394
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,940
好吧
All right, well,

395
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,230
等你回来后  这房间会非常凉快清爽
room will be nice and cool for you when you get back.

396
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,230
谢谢
Thanks.

397
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,000
顺便  你可能会见到我儿子
By the way, you might run into my son.

398
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,990
他参与的学校社团
He's part of a school group

399
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,340
这周都在参加会议
that's been at the convention all week,

400
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,880
我妻子刚告诉我
and my wife just told me

401
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,580
他们今晚也受邀参加派对
they got invited to that party tonight.

402
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,420
所以他特别激动
So he's pretty jazzed about it.

403
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,910
他叫杰瑞
His name's Gerry.

404
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,880
不是说你肯定会遇到他  但是谁知道呢
Not that you'll run into him, but who knows?

405
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,380
-杰瑞  -对  我叫史蒂夫
- Gerry. - Yeah. I'm Steve.

406
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,200
和你聊的很愉快
Nice chatting with you.

407
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,010
亚历克斯
Alex.

408
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,060
很高兴见到你  亚历克斯
Good to meet you, Alex.

409
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,000
今晚玩得开心
Have fun tonight,

410
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,360
祝你11月好运
and good luck in November.

411
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,420
谢谢
Thank you.

412
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:16,440
我要再去一次厕所
I'm actually gonna hit the bathroom one more time.

413
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:50,920
{\an8}妈妈
爸爸说你这周五不来了
下周末呢
我再联系你
我爱你

414
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,680
都修好了
All done!

415
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,560
-太好了  -是啊
- Great. - Yeah.

416
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,780
你看看
Check it out.

417
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,930
不了  我该走了
Nah, I-- I should go now.

418
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,580
站在我站的位置  亚历克斯
Stand where I'm standing, Alex.

419
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,690
感受一下
See how it feels.

420
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,700
我要迟到了
I'm late.

421
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,900
你在流汗
You're sweating.

422
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,490
来
Come on.

423
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:49,940
来
Come on.

424
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,230
相信我  你等下会谢我的
Believe me, you'll thank me later.

425
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,380
-我真的应该...  -坐下
- I should really-- - Sit down.

426
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,930
还有那东西吗
Still got that thing in there?

427
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,790
你的杯子
Oh, your cup.

428
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,380
小波本
Small batch, huh?
