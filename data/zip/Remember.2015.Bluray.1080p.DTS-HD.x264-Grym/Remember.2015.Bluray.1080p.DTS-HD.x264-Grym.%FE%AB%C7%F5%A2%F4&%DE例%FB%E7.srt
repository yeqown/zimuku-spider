I hope you're not too hungry.Breakfast is crummy as usual.

25
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,290
没关系 我不是很饿

你没必要告诉我所有人的名字
You don't have to tell me everyone's name.

32
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,450
今晚是为露丝服丧的最后一晚对吗
Tonight is the last night sitting shiva for Ruth, yes?

33
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,250
你还记不记得你说过露丝死后
Do you remember what you said you would do

34
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,870
你要做什么
when Ruth died?

35
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,460
不记得了
No.

36

43
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,590
你知道这张照片什么时候照的吗
Do you know when this picture was taken?

44
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,300
他们结婚的时候照的
It's from their wedding day.

45
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,470
1946年
1946.

46
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,010
你是在德国遇见奶奶的吗
Did you meet nanny in Germany?

47
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,770
噢 不 不是
Uh, no, no.

48
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,020
我在美国遇见她的
I met her in America.I met her...

49
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,360
在康尼
Coney...

50
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,730
- 在康尼岛 - 对
Coney Island.  Yeah.

51
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,700
嘿 为什么不拿给你哥哥看看呢
Why don't you show this to your brother, eh?

52
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,700
亚当 快看这个
Adam, look at this!

53
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,500

Here. Put this away in your pocket.

54
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,500

Now,

55
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,380
站起来

56
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,960
告诉所有人你累了
Tell everyone you're tired,

57
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,720
然后独自一人看完
and go read it alone.

58
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,550
独自一人
Alone.

59
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,390
你累了
You're tired.

60
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,930

65
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,910
真是漫长的一周
It's been a long week.

66
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,540
是啊
Yeah.

67
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,720
- 佩恩车站 对吗 - 是的

68
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,410

73
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,720
是的
Yeah.

74
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,600
她不和你一起吗
She's not coming with you?

75
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,680
不 我去找我爸爸
No. I'm going to see my dad.

76
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,020
噢
Oh.

77
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,980
所以你是一个人咯
So, you're traveling all alone?

78
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,860
不是一个人 我的兄弟们在那呢
I'm not alone.My brothers are right over there.

79
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,650
噢?
Oh?

80
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,530
噢 我看见了
Oh, I see.

81
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,120
你也是去克利夫兰吗
Are you going to Cleveland too?

82
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,620
是的
Yeah.

83
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,540
为什么不坐飞机呢 那样更快
Why don't you fly?It's faster.

84
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,670
我也不知道
I don't know.

85
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,670
这可不是个好理由
That's not a good reason.

86
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,590
你这个不知天高地厚的小孩
You're a real whipper snapper, aren't you?

87
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,050
那你为什么不坐飞机去克利夫兰呢
Why don't you fly to Cleveland?

88
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,550
三张飞机票太贵了
Three plane tickets is too expensive.

89
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,720
那是我爸妈说的
That's what my mom and dad said.

90
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,970
好吧 这是个好理由
Well, that is a good reason.

91
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,020
我不坐飞机是因为我朋友在他写给我的信里
I don't fly because my friend told me to take the train

92
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,650
告诉我要坐火车
in the letter he wrote to me.

93
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,820
我想这也是个好理由
I guess that's a good reason, too.

94
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,740
我叫泰勒
My name is Tyler.

95
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,240
很高兴认识你 泰勒
Nice to meet you, Tyler.

96
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,700
我叫泽夫
My name's Zev.

97
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,830
真是个奇怪的名字
That's a strange name.

98
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,750
在希伯来语里 它的意思是"狼"
In Hebrew, it means "Wolf."

99
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,130
真酷
Cool!

100
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,260
我为你计划了所有事项
I have planned everything for you.

101
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,220
你必须精准地执行这些步骤
You must follow these steps precisely.

102
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,770
每做完一项就划掉一项
Cross them off as you accomplish each task.

103
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,270
我们已经通知过警方 他们向社区发出了
We've notified the police and they've issued

104
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,690
银色警报并启动反911系统
a silver alert as well as a reverse 911

105
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,450
我们...我们这边会竭尽全力
to the community, our...our staff is doing all that we can.

106
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,870
- 确实难以接受... - 我只是不敢相信
It's upsetting.  I just can't believe

107
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,080
发生的这一切
this is happening.

108
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,950
我们感到万分的抱歉
I can't tell you how sorry we all are.

109
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,790
我们会密切留意每个人
We do our best to keep an eye on everybody,

110
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,750
但...我相信你能理解的
but... I'm sure you can understand.

111
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,840
我们能帮到什么吗
Is there anything we can do to help?

112
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,550
除了付钱让你们看丢人还有别的吗
Besides paying you to lose people?

113
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,970
你父亲有信用卡吗
Does your father have a credit card?

114
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,260
他一旦使用你可以让银行联系你
You can tell them to call you if he uses it.

115
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,770
听着
Listen.

116
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,640
你母亲的护工告诉我
Your mother's nursing aid told me that

117
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,190
你父亲最近特别糊涂
your dad's been very confused lately.

118
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,690
是的 他患有痴呆
Yeah, yeah.That's because he has dementia.

119
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,610
而这也是起初我母亲把父亲一起带到这来的原因
And that's why my mother brought them here in the first place.

120
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,900
我明白 但是
I understand that. However,

121
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,320
通常在配偶死亡后
it's very common after the death of a spouse

122
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,740
会出现更多认知障碍
for more signs of neurocognitive disorders to emerge.

123
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,120
你有没有注意到你父亲的情绪波动
Have you noticed that your father's been having mood swings?

124
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,830
而且他几乎不再弹钢琴了
And he rarely plays the piano anymore?

125
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,800
我察觉到了一些 查尔斯
I've noticed a few things, Charles.

126
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,720
我想那时我们
I guess we were...

127
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,180
在你母亲的事情上太操劳了以至于我没有理会这些
so busy with your mom that I just dismissed them.

128
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,680
安心吧 我们会让他在你知晓前平安回来的
Let me reassure you,we'll have him back here before you know it.

129
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,640
在这些情况下
In these situations,

130
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,980
人不会走太远
people never wander too far.

131
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,650
露丝?
Ruth?

132
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,700
露丝?
Ruth?

133
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,240
亚当?
Adam?

134
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,160
你奶奶在哪
Where is your grandmother?

135
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,790
亚当?
Adam?

136
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,330
你奶奶呢
Where is your grandmother?

137
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,800
你在跟我说话吗 泽夫
Were you talking to me, Zev?

138
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,960
我问你奶奶在哪
I asked you where your grandmother is.

139
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,180
一个在纽约州 一个在俄亥俄州
One is in New York.One is in Ohio.

140
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,100
你妹妹呢
Where is your sister?

141
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,390
我没有妹妹
I don't have a sister.

142
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,810
别玩那玩意儿了
Stop playing with that thing.

143
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,190
回答我
Answer me.

144
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,230
你...还好吗 泽夫
Are... are you okay, Zev?

145
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,700
我们在哪
Where are we?

146

00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,160

You're going to see a friend.

151
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,250
什么朋友
What friend?

152
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,840
给你写了你口袋里那封信的朋友
The one who wrote you the letter in your pocket.

153
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,010
能把我的游戏机还给我了吗
Can I have my PSP back?

154
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,950
露丝死了
Ruth is dead.

155
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,950

Excuse me.  Yeah?

158

Hi. Uh...My son there said that you were sitting

159
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,500
而你看起来有些糊涂了
next to him on the train and that you seemed a little confused.

160
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,670
噢 是的
Oh, yes, that.

I'm sorry about that.  Oh, no, no, no.

162
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,300
你不需要道歉 我们...
There's no need to apologize. We...

163
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,640
- 只是想确认你没事 - 噢我没事的
just want to make sure you're okay.  Oh, yes, I'm okay.

164
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,930
谢谢你 我很好
Thank you. I'm okay.

165
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,890
额...你要去哪需要帮忙吗
Um... You need help getting somewhere?

166
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,980
不用 会有人来接我的
No, no.Someone will be meeting me here.

167
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,900
我朋友说他会举一个
My friend said that he had a...

168
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,860

这些车刚到
The cars are just down here.

171
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,030
你是姓古特曼吗
Is your last name Guttman?

172
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,830
是的
Yeah.

173
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,870
你坐的车看起来很时髦
Looks like you're riding in style.

174
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,170
再见 泽夫
Bye, Zev.

175
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,460

我怎样帮到你呢
How can I help you?

181
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,030
我朋友向我推荐了你的店
My friend recommended your shop to me.

182
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,910
好的 请转告你的朋友我们很感谢他的推荐
Well, tell your friend we appreciate the recommendation.

183
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,200
- 你想要拿哪种呢 - 噢...
What are you looking to pick up?  Oh...

184
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,580
小一点的
Something small.

185
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,790
当然有
Sure thing. Okay.

186
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,830
- 能给我看看你的驾驶证吗 - 好的
Can I see your driver's license?  Yeah.

187
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,050
这儿...
Yeah...

188
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,380
好的
Okay.

189
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,140
比奇伍德 很棒的小镇
Beachwood. Nice town.

190
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,850
是的 但...
Yes. But, um...

191
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,470
我们搬走了
We've moved.

192
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,390
我们搬去离我儿子更近的住处了
We live closer to my son.

193
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,860
你拿我的驾驶证干什么
What are you doing with my license?

194
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,940
我在把你的信息输入FBI的背景调查数据库
I'm entering your information into the FBI background check database.

195
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,240
噢
Oh.

196
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,150
他们在调查什么
What do they look for?

197
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,780
一大堆资料 看你是否为已被定罪的重刑犯
A bunch of stuff.Whether you're a convicted felon,

198
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,490
涉嫌暴力犯罪
if you've been involved in a crime of violence,

199
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,200
被军队惩戒免职
dishonorably discharged from the army,

200
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,290
是否智力健全 或者是否过去五年内
mentally competent.If you've got more than one DUI offense

201
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,330
不止一次酒驾 是否是个逃犯
in the last five years,if you're a fugitive,

202
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,250
- 或者最近被指控重罪 - 逃犯?
or currently charged with a felony.  Fugitive?

203
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,840
是的 比如你在逃脱法律的制裁
Yeah, like, if you're running from the law.

204
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,090
你觉得我看起来逃得动吗
Do I look like I can run?

205
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,140
好吧 给你看些小一点的手枪
Uh, okay. Let me show you some of our smaller handguns.

206
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,270
我们应有尽有 西格绍尔 M1911 格洛克（均为手枪型号）
We got everything.SIG Sauers, 1911s, Glocks,

207
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,930
单动枪 双动枪
single action, double action.

208
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,140
- 先生 你懂枪吗 - 额...
Sir, do you know much about guns?  Um...

209
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,520
- 不懂 怎么了 - 那没关系
No. Why?     It's all right.

210
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,150
我们这什么类型的都有
We get all types in here.

211
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,240
好吧 新手的话...
Uh, okay. Beginners...

212
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,360
通常是用点22口径的
usually go with a .22.

213
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,570
它很轻 易上手 后坐力很小
It's light. Easy to use.Very little recoil.

214
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,540
我觉得这就是我朋友建议的
I think that's what my friend suggested.

215
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,370
好吧 依我来看
Okay. In my opinion,

216
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,420
你买点22就相当于拥有了一把气枪
you might as well get yourself a BB gun if you get a .22.

217
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,090
嘿 我不是在强行推销 但多花500块
Look, I'm not trying to give you the hard sell, but $500 more,

218
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,300
你能拥有一把真正有制动能力的枪
you can get yourself a gun with real stopping power.

219
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,550
这个是格洛克17 9mm手枪
Now this is a 9mm Glock 17.

220
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,930
格洛克? 这是德国枪 对吗
Glock? It is German, no?

221
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,470
接近正确答案了 它产自奥地利
You're in the right neighborhood.Manufactured in Austria.

222
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,270
这是世界上最流行的执法手枪 不错吧
That's the most popular law enforcement pistol in the world. Okay?

223
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,860
它的后坐力非常小 所以应该不会伤到手
It's got very little recoil so probably won't hurt your hand

224
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,820
但它肯定会伤到入侵者
but it'll definitely hurt the intruder.

225
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,490
这个好用吗
Is it easy to use?

226
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,070
但愿
I hope!

227
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,610
是的 它很简易
Yeah, it's simple.

228
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,700
好吧 但是...
Yeah, but...

229
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,160
不知你介不介意 可不可以
Would you mind, could you...

230
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,160
帮我写个使用说明书
write down the instructions for me?

231
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,920
当然可以 我的意思是 我可以示范给你看怎么使用
Uh, sure. I mean,I can show you how to use it.

232
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,710
不了 那是很好 但拜托了 帮我写下来吧
No, that would be good.But please, write it down for me.

233
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,420
我有时候会健忘
Sometimes I forget things.

234
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,560
顾客至上 这没问题
Yeah, we all do, right?That's no problem.

235
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,440
好的 一切都妥当了
Okay, you're good to go.

236
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,400
我去拿支笔 然后
I'll grab a pen, and um...

237
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,360
帮你写下使用说明
write it all down for you.

238
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,280
- 古特曼先生吗 - 对 古特曼
Mr. Guttman?    Guttman. Yeah...

239
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,490
你怎么知道
How did you know?

240
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,290
你朋友早些时候打过电话说你快到了
Your friend called earlier and said you'd be arriving soon.

241
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,120
房间已经为你准备好了
Your room's all ready for you.

242
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,040
房间号是
We have you in...

243
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,040
125 就顺着走廊走
125. Just down the hall.

244
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,510
- 我该付多少钱 - 已经付过了
How much do I owe?  It's all taken care of,

245
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,260
包括附加费
including incidentals.

246
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,930
对了 应你朋友的要求 我们为你订了明天早上的出租车
Oh, and I booked your taxi for the morning,like your friend asked.

247
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,430
谢谢你
Thank you.

248
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,450

看不清楚
I can't see.

266
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,510
- 你好 - 嗨

得亮堂些我才能看清你的脸

287
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,810
- 把头转过去 - 你是谁
Turn your head.        Who are you?

288
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,430
别吼
Don't yell.

289
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,770
拜托 不要吼
Please, don't yell.

290
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,970
按我说的做 抬起头来
Do as I say. Turn your head.

291
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,570
你是德国人吗
Are you German?

292
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,100
是的
Yeah.

293
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,900
- 你也是德国人? (德语) - 是

294
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,690
你多少岁了
How old are you?

295
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,990
88 Eighty-eight.

296
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,120
你曾在德军服役吗

297
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,950
你在军队里做什么

00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,750
- 那都过去了 - 英语 请说英语
It is in the past.        English. Please, English.

299

- 我不喜欢说德语 - 那都是70年前了
I do not like to speak German.        It's seventy years ago.

300
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,010
我那时太年轻
I was very young-

301
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,630
回答我的问题
Answer the question.

302
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,590
你是犹太人?
Are you a Jew?

303
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,060
没错
Yeah.

304
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,140
- 你当时在奥斯维辛集中营吗 - 我不在
Were you at Auschwitz?        No!

305
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,890
我们都这个岁数了 还有必要撒谎吗
We are too old for lies.

306
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,610
在战争结束前
I didn't know about Auschwitz

307
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,150
我都不知道奥斯维辛集中营的事
until after the war.

308
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,070
我当时在北非
I was in North Africa.

309
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,030
和隆美尔元帅一起
With General Rommel.

310
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,990
- 你有证据吗 - 有
You have proof?        Yes.

311
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,960
就在那边
Over there.

312
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,010
当我成为美国公民的时候 移民局的官员问我
When I became a US citizen, the immigration officer asked me

313
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,470
是否曾和纳粹政府
if I had ever associated

314
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,810
有关联
with the Nazi government of Germany

315
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,930
或者是否曾在集中营工作
or worked at a concentration camp.

316
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,520
我的回答说
I told the officer what I'll tell you.

317
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,860
是的 我效忠于我的国家 我是一名军人
Yes, I served for my country. I was a soldier.

318
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,200
我为自己身为德国人而自豪 所有人都为自己的国家而自豪
I was a proud German and that's what the men did.

319
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,200
我仍然为我为国家作出的贡献感到自豪
I'm still proud of my service.

320
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,130
这是隆美尔元帅
That's Rommel.

321
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,550
至于犹太人
As far as the Jews...

322
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,140
我并不关心犹太人 我认为希特勒是对的
I didn't care about the Jews. I thought Hitler was right.

323
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,230
犹太人给我们国家带来了太多麻烦
They caused many problems for the country.

324
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,030
我认为我们是在驱逐他们 或是把他们安置在劳动营里...
I thought we were deporting them or putting them in work camps...

325
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,650
而不是像他们所做的那样
Not what they did.

326
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,610
那太可耻了
It was shameful,

327
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,910
但我没有做那些事
but that was not me.

328
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,050
- 喂? - 是马克斯吗
Hello?        Is this Max?

329
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,970
是我
Yes.

330
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,890
我是泽夫
This is Zev.

331
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,640

00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,940
- 你确定吗 - 我确定
Are you sure?        Yeah, I'm sure.

334
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,860
那你必须要继续

335

必须履行
You must do

336
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,860
你曾经承诺过的
what you said you would.

337
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
近些年来一直有传闻
There have been rumors for years

338
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,010
一些奥斯维辛集中营里的党卫队军官
that a number of Auschwitz SS officers

339
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,980
在战争接近尾声的时候
stole the identities of executed prisoners

340
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,810
冒名顶替了被处死的犹太人的身份
near the end of the war.

341
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,520
在我中风后不久

342

有证据表明 一名奥斯维辛集中营军官

344
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:14,160
并且最可能用假名鲁迪・库兰德

继续生活

然而 没有足够的证据

350

逮捕他们其中任何一人

他的真名是奥托・瓦利施

352
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,770
你必须要找到他

你爸爸跟你谈起过德国吗
Did your father ever talk to you about Germany?

560
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,650
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

561

见证了历史的开端

You know?

583
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,620

我已经卖掉了大部分的收藏
I already sold most of the collection

586
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:13,590
但是 这些是跟他有感情的
but, uh, these are the things he was sentimental about.

587
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:19,340
连我也还没办法卖了它们 你知道吗
Just haven't been able to let myself get rid of 'em, you know?

588
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,350
你想到处看看吗

A guy offered me six grand for it but I just... just couldn't part with it.

I guess I'm just as sentimental as my old man, huh?

六个月前 上帝赐我好运
Six months ago, God smiled upon me

797
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:44,110
当你搬到高级社区后
when you moved to the senior housing community.

798

我立刻就认出了那个曾在奥斯维辛的你

尽管你已经不记得我

还能认出杀害我们家人的凶手面孔的人
who could still recognize the face of the man who murdered our families.

803
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:13,270
西蒙・威森塔尔坚持认为

所有战犯都应当受到公开审判

01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:23,650
但是 我们不能给瓦利施这个机会

893
01:16:55,900 --> 01:17:00,360
我女儿说来了个我认识的奥斯维辛人
My daughter said someone I knew from Auschwitz was here.

894
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:04,700
但作为一个幸存者不应该喜欢瓦格纳的 不是吗 (瓦格纳 德国作曲家 种族主义者 反犹太主义者)
But a survivor should not like Wagner, no?

895
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:07,990
音乐又不可恨
You can't hate music.

896
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:14,210
我 呃 没能在那些照片中认出你
I, uh, didn't recognize your face in those pictures.

897
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:16,710
但是...
But...

898
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:23,970
你的声音...
Your voice...

899
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:29,720
没变
has not changed.

900
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,730
我知道有一天你会来找我
I knew you would come to find me one day.

901
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:40,400
外公 泽夫是你朋友吗
Zev's your friend, Poppy?

902
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:43,240
英格 请你回厨房去
Inge, please go back into the kitchen.

903
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,070
我得跟我朋友探讨些事
My friend and I need to discuss some things.

904
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,370
我没忘记你
I have not forgotten you.

905
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:56,080
来吧...我们到外面去
Please... let us go outside.

906
01:17:57,380 --> 01:18:01,050
我不想让我的家人听见...我们要说的事
I do not want my family to hear...what we have to say.

907
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:08,800
已经有很久...
It has been a long time...

908
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:12,930
没人认出从前的我了
since anyone knew who I was.

909
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:17,350
我甚至记不清有多久
I cannot even remember when.

910
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:24,280
这些年来 人们盯着我看
Over the years people have looked at me

911
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:29,780
我就以为他们认出我了 其实他们从来没有
and I think they know, but they never do.

912
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:36,920
或许他们只是太害怕 所以什么都不敢说
Or maybe they were just too scared to say anything.

913
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:45,300
有时候 我会到这来 说出自己的名字
Sometimes, I come out here and speak my name.

914
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,140
我自言自语
I talk to myself.

915
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:54,100
重新回忆起以前的那个我
I remind myself of who I was.

916
01:18:57,350 --> 01:19:01,310
这是唯一一种让我知道自己存在过的方式
It is the only way to know I existed...

917
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:05,740
在我变成现在这个人之前的那个自我
before I became who I am now.

918
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:13,200
好吧 靠谎言过活算什么人生
Well, living a lie is not a life.

919
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,830
我一直都知道你会找到我
I always knew you would find me.

920
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,300
已经过了太久
It has been too long.

921
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:28,970
现在我们都是老人了
We are old men now.

922
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:35,010
把你的手拿开 奥托
Take your hands off of me, Otto.

923
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:38,810
什么
Excuse me?

924
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:42,060
我说 "把你的手拿开"
I said, "Take your hands off of me."

925
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:47,440
你叫我奥托?
You called me Otto.

926
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:49,110
我想你弄糊涂了
I think you're confused.

927
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:53,240
没有 你的名字叫奥托・瓦利施
No, your name is Otto Wallisch.

928
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:57,040
你是奥斯维辛的一个狱长 You were a Blockführer at Auschwitz.

929
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:01,000
你杀了我的家人
And you killed my family.

930
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:04,380
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

931
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:08,930
你自欺欺人这么久
You've lived a lie for so long

932
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:12,340
你自己都信以为真了
you've convinced yourself it is true.

933
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:14,970
我...
I...

934
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,100
我不明白
I do not understand.

935
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:20,270
那我来帮你
Let me help you...

936
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,150
弄明白
understand.

937
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:36,200
感觉像我们开了家旅馆
It's like we're running a hotel.

938

我想我父亲在这

嗨 真抱歉打扰您
