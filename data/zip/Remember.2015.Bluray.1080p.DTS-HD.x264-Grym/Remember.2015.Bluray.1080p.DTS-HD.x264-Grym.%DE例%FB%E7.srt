1
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,350
Ruth?

2
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,650
Ruth?

3
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,310
Where's my wife?

4
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,810
Mr. Guttman!You can't be sneaking up on me like that!

5
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,150
Where is my wife?Where is Ruth?

6
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,780
I'm sorry, Mr. Guttman,

7
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,450
your wife passed away about a week ago.

8
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,700
Ah.

9
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,470
I'm sorry. Who are you?

10
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,430
My name's Paula.

11
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,810
I was Mrs. Guttman's nursing aide.

12
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,140
Your family asked me to stay on for another week or two.

13
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,480
Let's get some breakfast.

14
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,230
You'll be feeling better after breakfast.

15
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,900
Where are your shoes?

16
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,690
Hold on, let me get you some slippers.Tell you what.

17
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,530
Trade your hat for some slippers, okay?

18
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,240
All right. Now come in.

19
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,410
Good morning, Zev.  Good morning.

20
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,370
I hope you're not too hungry.Breakfast is crummy as usual.

21
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,290
That's okay.I'm not too hungry.

22
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,750
That's Cele. She was friends with your wife.

23
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,380
I know who she is.I know who she is.

24
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,270
Could you give us a minute, please?

25
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,640
Oh, no problem...

26
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,480
Max.

27
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,940
You don't have to tell me everyone's name.

28
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,450
Tonight is the last night sitting shiva for Ruth, yes?

29
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,250
Do you remember what you said you would do

30
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,870
when Ruth died?

31
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,460
No.

32
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,420
It's okay. It's okay.

33
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,800
I...

34
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,930
wrote everything down

35
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,850
so you...

36
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,430
could remember.

37
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,190
Come on, Mr. Rosenbaum.

38
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,540
Darling.

39
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,590
Do you know when this picture was taken?

40
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,300
It's from their wedding day.

41
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,470
1946.

42
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,010
Did you meet nanny in Germany?

43
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,770
Uh, no, no.

44
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,020
I met her in America.I met her...

45
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,360
Coney...

46
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,730
Coney Island.  Yeah.

47
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,700
Why don't you show this to your brother, eh?

48
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,700
Adam, look at this!

49
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,500
Here. Put this away in your pocket.

50
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,500
Now,

51
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,380
stand up.

52
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,960
Tell everyone you're tired,

53
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,720
and go read it alone.

54
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,550
Alone.

55
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,390
You're tired.

56
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,930
Yeah, yeah.

57
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,720
Yeah. Good.

58
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,400
Forgive me, I...

59
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,900
I'm a little tired,I think I should go to bed.

60
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,030
Yeah. Okay, Dad.

61
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,910
It's been a long week.

62
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,540
Yeah.

63
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,720
Penn Station, right?  Yeah.

64
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,410
Last call!

65
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,620
49 Lake Shore Limited!

66
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,120
Last call!

67
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,000
Last call,49 Lake Shore Limited!

68
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,840
Is that your mother?

69
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,720
Yeah.

70
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,600
She's not coming with you?

71
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,680
No. I'm going to see my dad.

72
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,020
Oh.

73
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,980
So, you're traveling all alone?

74
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,860
I'm not alone.My brothers are right over there.

75
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,650
Oh?

76
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,530
Oh, I see.

77
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,120
Are you going to Cleveland too?

78
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,620
Yeah.

79
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,540
Why don't you fly?It's faster.

80
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,670
I don't know.

81
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,670
That's not a good reason.

82
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,590
You're a real whipper snapper, aren't you?

83
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,050
Why don't you fly to Cleveland?

84
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,550
Three plane tickets is too expensive.

85
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,720
That's what my mom and dad said.

86
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,970
Well, that is a good reason.

87
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,020
I don't fly because my friend told me to take the train

88
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,650
in the letter he wrote to me.

89
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,820
I guess that's a good reason, too.

90
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,740
My name is Tyler.

91
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,240
Nice to meet you, Tyler.

92
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,700
My name's Zev.

93
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,830
That's a strange name.

94
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,750
In Hebrew, it means "Wolf."

95
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,130
Cool!

96
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,260
I have planned everything for you.

97
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,220
You must follow these steps precisely.

98
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,770
Cross them off as you accomplish each task.

99
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,270
We've notified the police and they've issued

100
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,690
a silver alert as well as a reverse 911

101
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,450
to the community, our...our staff is doing all that we can.

102
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,870
It's upsetting.  I just can't believe

103
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,080
this is happening.

104
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,950
I can't tell you how sorry we all are.

105
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,790
We do our best to keep an eye on everybody,

106
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,750
but... I'm sure you can understand.

107
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,840
Is there anything we can do to help?

108
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,550
Besides paying you to lose people?

109
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,970
Does your father have a credit card?

110
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,260
You can tell them to call you if he uses it.

111
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,770
Listen.

112
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,640
Your mother's nursing aid told me that

113
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,190
your dad's been very confused lately.

114
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,690
Yeah, yeah.That's because he has dementia.

115
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,610
And that's why my mother brought them here in the first place.

116
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,900
I understand that. However,

117
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,320
it's very common after the death of a spouse

118
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,740
for more signs of neurocognitive disorders to emerge.

119
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,120
Have you noticed that your father's been having mood swings?

120
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,830
And he rarely plays the piano anymore?

121
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,800
I've noticed a few things, Charles.

122
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,720
I guess we were...

123
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,180
so busy with your mom that I just dismissed them.

124
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,680
Let me reassure you,we'll have him back here before you know it.

125
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,640
In these situations,

126
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,980
people never wander too far.

127
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,650
Ruth?

128
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,700
Ruth?

129
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,240
Adam?

130
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,160
Where is your grandmother?

131
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,790
Adam?

132
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,330
Where is your grandmother?

133
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,800
Were you talking to me, Zev?

134
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,960
I asked you where your grandmother is.

135
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,180
One is in New York.One is in Ohio.

136
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,100
Where is your sister?

137
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,390
I don't have a sister.

138
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,810
Stop playing with that thing.

139
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,190
Answer me.

140
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,230
Are... are you okay, Zev?

141
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,700
Where are we?

142
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,070
We're on a train.

143
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,160
To where?

144
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,780
Cleveland.

145
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,910
Cleveland?

146
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,870
You're going to see a friend.

147
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,250
What friend?

148
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,840
The one who wrote you the letter in your pocket.

149
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,010
Can I have my PSP back?

150
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,950
Ruth is dead.

151
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,950
Zev,

152
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,920
I'm going to sit with my brothers for a little bit.

153
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,160
Excuse me.  Yeah?

154
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,960
Hi. Uh...My son there said that you were sitting

155
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,500
next to him on the train and that you seemed a little confused.

156
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,670
Oh, yes, that.

157
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,510
I'm sorry about that.  Oh, no, no, no.

158
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,300
There's no need to apologize. We...

159
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,640
just want to make sure you're okay.  Oh, yes, I'm okay.

160
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,930
Thank you. I'm okay.

161
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,890
Um... You need help getting somewhere?

162
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,980
No, no.Someone will be meeting me here.

163
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,900
My friend said that he had a...

164
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,860
sign with my name on it.

165
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,230
Okay. Well, we'll help you find him.

166
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,110
The cars are just down here.

167
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,030
Is your last name Guttman?

168
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,830
Yeah.

169
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,870
Looks like you're riding in style.

170
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,170
Bye, Zev.

171
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,460
Goodbye. Goodbye.

172
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,340
Let's go, boys.

173
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,090
Mr. Guttman?  Yeah.

174
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,050
Good.

175
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,560
Good evening.  Evening.

176
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,730
How can I help you?

177
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,030
My friend recommended your shop to me.

178
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,910
Well, tell your friend we appreciate the recommendation.

179
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,200
What are you looking to pick up?  Oh...

180
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,580
Something small.

181
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,790
Sure thing. Okay.

182
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,830
Can I see your driver's license?  Yeah.

183
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,050
Yeah...

184
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,380
Okay.

185
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,140
Beachwood. Nice town.

186
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,850
Yes. But, um...

187
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,470
We've moved.

188
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,390
We live closer to my son.

189
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,860
What are you doing with my license?

190
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,940
I'm entering your information into the FBI background check database.

191
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,240
Oh.

192
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,150
What do they look for?

193
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,780
A bunch of stuff.Whether you're a convicted felon,

194
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,490
if you've been involved in a crime of violence,

195
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,200
dishonorably discharged from the army,

196
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,290
mentally competent.If you've got more than one DUI offense

197
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,330
in the last five years,if you're a fugitive,

198
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,250
or currently charged with a felony.  Fugitive?

199
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,840
Yeah, like, if you're running from the law.

200
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,090
Do I look like I can run?

201
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,140
Uh, okay. Let me show you some of our smaller handguns.

202
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,270
We got everything.SIG Sauers, 1911s, Glocks,

203
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,930
single action, double action.

204
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,140
Sir, do you know much about guns?  Um...

205
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,520
No. Why?     It's all right.

206
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,150
We get all types in here.

207
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,240
Uh, okay. Beginners...

208
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,360
usually go with a .22.

209
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,570
It's light. Easy to use.Very little recoil.

210
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,540
I think that's what my friend suggested.

211
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,370
Okay. In my opinion,

212
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,420
you might as well get yourself a BB gun if you get a .22.

213
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,090
Look, I'm not trying to give you the hard sell, but $500 more,

214
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,300
you can get yourself a gun with real stopping power.

215
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,550
Now this is a 9mm Glock 17.

216
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,930
Glock? It is German, no?

217
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,470
You're in the right neighborhood.Manufactured in Austria.

218
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,270
That's the most popular law enforcement pistol in the world. Okay?

219
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,860
It's got very little recoil so probably won't hurt your hand

220
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,820
but it'll definitely hurt the intruder.

221
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,490
Is it easy to use?

222
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,070
I hope!

223
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,610
Yeah, it's simple.

224
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,700
Yeah, but...

225
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,160
Would you mind, could you...

226
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,160
write down the instructions for me?

227
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,920
Uh, sure. I mean,I can show you how to use it.

228
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,710
No, that would be good.But please, write it down for me.

229
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,420
Sometimes I forget things.

230
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,560
Yeah, we all do, right?That's no problem.

231
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,440
Okay, you're good to go.

232
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,400
I'll grab a pen, and um...

233
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,360
write it all down for you.

234
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,280
Mr. Guttman?    Guttman. Yeah...

235
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,490
How did you know?

236
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,290
Your friend called earlier and said you'd be arriving soon.

237
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,120
Your room's all ready for you.

238
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,040
We have you in...

239
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,040
125. Just down the hall.

240
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,510
How much do I owe?  It's all taken care of,

241
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,260
including incidentals.

242
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,930
Oh, and I booked your taxi for the morning,like your friend asked.

243
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,430
Thank you.

244
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,450
Hello?  Hello.

245
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,660
Zev?    Yeah.

246
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,160
It's Max.

247
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,290
I gave the hotel some instructions.

248
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,170
Are you okay?  Yes, yes, I'm okay, Max.

249
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,420
And you got the gun?

250
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,590
Yeah, yeah.

251
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,680
Good. Good.

252
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,510
You know what to do.

253
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,470
Just take care of yourself, yeah?

254
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,230
You have a good night, Max.

255
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,650
Good night, Zev.

256
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,560
Ruth?

257
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,360
Ruth?

258
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,360
Ruth?

259
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,540
Turn on the lights, please.

260
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,870
It's dark in here. I can't...

261
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,880
I can't see.

262
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,510
Hello.        Hi.

263
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,500
Is Rudy Kurlander home?

264
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,380
Yeah. He is downstairs.

265
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,000
Are you...

266
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,670
Rudy Kurlander?

267
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,550
Yes.

268
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,340
I'm Rudy Kurlander.

269
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,130
Who are you?

270
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,470
Can you, uh...

271
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,970
turn off the television?

272
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,360
Do I know you?

273
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,450
Now, please...

274
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,990
stand by the window.

275
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,820
Who are you?

276
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,290
Stand by the window.

277
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,420
I am not going to do anything until you tell me

278
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,290
who you are and why you're here.

279
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,510
Let us not argue.

280
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,010
Just stand by the window.

281
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,580
Now what?

282
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,390
I need to see light on your face.

283
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,810
Turn your head.        Who are you?

284
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,430
Don't yell.

285
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,770
Please, don't yell.

286
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,970
Do as I say. Turn your head.

287
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,570
Are you German?

288
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,100
Yeah.

289
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,900
You are also German?        Ja.

290
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,690
How old are you?

291
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,120
Were you in the German army?

292
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,950
What did you do?

293
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,750
It is in the past.        English. Please, English.

294
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:01,550
I do not like to speak German.        It's seventy years ago.

295
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,010
I was very young-

296
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,630
Answer the question.

297
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,590
Are you a Jew?

298
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,060
Yeah.

299
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,140
Were you at Auschwitz?        No!

300
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,890
We are too old for lies.

301
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,610
I didn't know about Auschwitz

302
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,150
until after the war.

303
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,070
I was in North Africa.

304
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,030
With General Rommel.

305
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,990
You have proof?        Yes.

306
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,960
Over there.

307
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,010
When I became a US citizen, the immigration officer asked me

308
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,470
if I had ever associated

309
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,810
with the Nazi government of Germany

310
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,930
or worked at a concentration camp.

311
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,520
I told the officer what I'll tell you.

312
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,860
Yes, I served for my country. I was a soldier.

313
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,200
I was a proud German and that's what the men did.

314
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,200
I'm still proud of my service.

315
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,130
That's Rommel.

316
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,550
As far as the Jews...

317
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,140
I didn't care about the Jews. I thought Hitler was right.

318
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,230
They caused many problems for the country.

319
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,030
I thought we were deporting them or putting them in work camps...

320
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,650
Not what they did.

321
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,610
It was shameful,

322
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,910
but that was not me.

323
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,050
Hello?        Is this Max?

324
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,970
Yes.

325
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,890
This is Zev.

326
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,640
Uh... It was...

327
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,270
not him.

328
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,940
Are you sure?        Yeah, I'm sure.

329
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,860
Then you must go on.

330
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,200
You must do

331
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,860
what you said you would.

332
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
There have been rumors for years

333
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,010
that a number of Auschwitz SS officers

334
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,980
stole the identities of executed prisoners

335
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,810
near the end of the war.

336
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,520
Shortly after my stroke,

337
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,060
evidence was found that an Auschwitz Blockfuhrer

338
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,190
emigrated from Germany in the 1940s

339
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:14,160
and was most likely living under the name

340
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,570
Rudy Kurlander.

341
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,490
The Simon Wiesenthal Center

342
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,840
has found four Rudy Kurlanders

343
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,250
who emigrated during that period.

344
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,540
However, there is not enough proof

345
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,590
to arrest any of them.

346
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,350
His real name is Otto Wallisch.

347
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,770
You must find him.

348
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:52,360
I'm looking for my father. He's almost 90 years old.

349
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,080
His name is Zev.

350
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,790
I'm looking for my father.

351
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,910
He's 90 years old.

352
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,750
He went wandering a few days ago.

353
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,540
His name is Zev Guttman.

354
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,880
I don't know if he has any identification on him,

355
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,840
or... I don't even know if he remembers his name.

356
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,300
I've been wondering if anybody has been brought into the hospital.

357
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,060
Do you not think I've already called the police?

358
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,820
Ladies and gentlemen,

359
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,280
we're approaching the Canadian border,

360
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,520
at which point, we're all gonna have to get off the bus for inspection.

361
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,950
If you can have your passports and any travel documents ready,

362
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,990
it'll make the process a lot faster. Thank you.

363
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,930
Declaration card?

364
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,810
Purpose of your trip?

365
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,440
To see a friend.

366
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,740
What's your friend's name?

367
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,950
Rudy Kurlander.       Where does he live?

368
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,440
Foyer Des... Foyer...

369
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,240
Can I see that?        Yeah, of course.

370
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,250
Foyer Des Pionniers Nursing Home?        Yeah.

371
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,670
And you'll be staying at the Queen's Motel in Hearst, Ontario?

372
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,790
That's right.

373
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,470
How long will you be in Canada?

374
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,800
Two nights. Maybe.

375
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,180
Passport?

376
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,950
Sir, your passport's expired.

377
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,120
It is?        Yeah.

378
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,050
Do you have a driver's license?

379
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,910
Oh, of course.

380
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,140
Hang on a second.

381
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,320
Alright, you're good to go.

382
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,280
But, sir, renew your passport.

383
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,160
I didn't think it was necessary at my age.

384
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,030
Have fun with your friend.

385
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,530
Thank you.

386
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,700
Excuse me.

387
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,910
How can I help you, sir?

388
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:30,580
Rudy Kurlander. Which room is he in?

389
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,410
Kurlander?

390
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,910
Yes, Kurlander. He's in room 238.

391
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,170
Just go down this hallway and take the elevators.

392
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:41,920
When you exit the elevator, make a left, then you take a right.

393
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,970
238 will be on your left.

394
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,600
Did you get that?

395
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,970
Why don't I just show you where your friend's room is?

396
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,090
Thank you.

397
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,460
Are you Rudy Kurlander?

398
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,760
Rudy Kurlander?

399
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,130
Here.

400
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:58,000
Are you Rudy Kurlander?        Yeah.

401
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,210
Are you German?

402
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,050
Yes.

403
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,470
Were you at Auschwitz?

404
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,350
Yes.

405
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,020
I was at Auschwitz.

406
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,150
My whole family was

407
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,240
murdered

408
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,410
at Auschwitz.

409
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,500
I'm so sorry.

410
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,170
You're... you're sorry?

411
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,300
Yeah.

412
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:51,420
What you did is something you cannot apologize for.

413
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,060
I swore I would kill the man responsible

414
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,020
for the death of my family.

415
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,320
You're Jewish?

416
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,490
Homosexual.

417
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,210
It is I who am sorry.

418
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:32,090
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

419
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,140
Moszkowski.

420
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,840
You know Moszkowski?

421
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:59,020
My old piano teacher used to say

422
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,680
that the three greatest composers

423
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,770
were Mendelssohn, Meyerbeer

424
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,600
and Moszkowski.

425
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,860
Do you still play?        Oh...

426
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,240
No.

427
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,450
No, I don't know, I'm not sure!

428
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,690
Well...

429
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:19,660
Why don't you give it a try?

430
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,290
Oh... Well...

431
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,170
Mendelssohn.

432
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,750
Maybe.

433
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,320
Hello, sir. Welcome to Boise.

434
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,990
Do you have a reservation?

435
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,370
I have a note that you need a taxi pickup at 8:00 am.

436
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:30,490
So, we have our complimentary breakfast which starts at 6:00 a.m.

437
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,720
And if you just head through the lobby to your left...

438
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,550
Here, let me help you, okay?

439
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:55,390
There is one thing. I forgot to pack more clothes.

440
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,900
Extra clothes.        Oh!

441
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,520
We can definitely help you out with that.

442
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:02,400
So, there's a downtown shuttle that leaves every hour on the hour

443
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:06,280
and it's going to drop you right off at the mall on North Milwaukee street.

444
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:09,710
You should be able to get everything you need there...

445
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,680
Sir, would you like me to do that?

446
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,720
Sir, are you okay?

447
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,300
Would you like to head up to your room now? Okay.

448
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,700
Can I help you find anything?        Oh, yes.

449
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,070
I want to buy a new shirt.

450
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,910
We have a great deal on short-sleeve button downs.

451
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:48,950
Yeah?        Can I show you?

452
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,950
Thank you.        Yeah.

453
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,200
You can always find the best deals at the end of the season.

454
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,750
Oh, right.

455
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,970
Excuse me, sir. You set off the alarm.

456
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,810
I'm gonna have to check your bag.

457
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,850
Oh. Do I look like a thief?

458
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,600
Oh, it doesn't matter, sir, you set off the alarm.

459
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,890
I've got to check your bag no matter what, so...

460
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,020
There's the receipt.

461
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,600
Oh, there's your problem right there.

462
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,610
They left the security tag on.

463
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,950
I'll have to check your other bag too, sir.

464
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:35,950
Is that a Glock?

465
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Yeah.

466
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,840
Reminds me of my first gun.

467
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,420
You have a good day, sir.

468
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,850
There you go. Thanks very much.        Thank you. Thank you...

469
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,320
Would you like a refill?

470
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,320
Yes. Thank you.        You're very welcome.

471
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,540
Could you tell me how far is Bruneau is from here?

472
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,580
I've never actually been to Bruneau, but it's in Owyhee County,

473
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,540
so, I'd say that should probably take you about 30, 40 minutes or so.

474
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,790
Oh.        I heard it's beautiful country down there.

475
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,460
I never get to go but my friends...

476
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,710
Oh!        Ah.

477
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,010
Oh, I'm so sorry!

478
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,920
I got coffee on your letter.        Oh, God.

479
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,010
No, you're ruining my letter!

480
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:11,930
No, no, no!        I'm sorry.

481
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:15,550
This letter is very important! Stop! Stop! Stop!

482
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,980
"Besides me,

483
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,200
"you are the only person

484
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:34,910
"who can still recognize

485
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:41,870
"the face of the man

486
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:48,210
"who murdered our families."

487
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,310
Nobody's home?        No.

488
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,180
You want me to take you somewhere else?

489
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:44,100
No, no, no. I will wait.        Here.

490
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:49,150
Give me a call whenever you want me to come back and get you.

491
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:51,230
What do I owe you?

492
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,080
Oh, you already paid me, remember?

493
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,200
Just call me if you need a ride later.

494
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:49,870
Morning.

495
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,800
Morning to you too, sweetie.

496
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,720
Yeah...

497
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:12,900
Dinner time, Mr. Rosenbaum.

498
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:17,230
Bring me back some food, yeah?

499
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,950
Are you sure? You haven't been outside the apartment all day.

500
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:23,740
Yes.        Okay.

501
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,240
Can I help you with something?

502
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,910
I'm looking for Rudy Kurlander.

503
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:06,120
Well, you came to the right place but, uh...

504
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,710
My old man passed away about three months ago.

505
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,460
Oh, I didn't know this. I am so sorry.

506
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,970
How long have you been waiting here?

507
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:27,470
All day.

508
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:32,190
You want a drink?

509
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:35,440
A drink would be nice.

510
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:37,780
Come on in.

511
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,150
I could use another drink myself.

512
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,780
Thank you.        Beer or a water?

513
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,110
Just water, please.

514
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,870
Oh, Eva. Good girl. Good girl.

515
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:54,500
Listen, I am a little scared of dogs.

516
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:56,500
Eva's all bark and no bite.Come on in.

517
00:45:56,870 --> 00:46:00,340
But I'm sure that's true but I'm... I'm quite scared.

518
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,300
Oh, I'll put her away for you. Okay.

519
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,630
Here we go. Good girl.

520
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,010
Quiet, girl. Eva!

521
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,760
Eva, shush, quiet.

522
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,850
Girl, quiet. Calm down, Eva. Shush.

523
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:13,350
Eva, shush. Shush.

524
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,980
Eva, calm down now. Calm down.

525
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,980
Quiet!

526
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,380
That's my, um, kid's graduation.

527
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,260
Dad always loved that photo.

528
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:48,180
- I'm gonna get... grab your water for you. - Yeah.

529
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:50,930
When was that taken? Your father looks so young.

530
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,510
That was, uh, in 1997.

531
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,890
- Oh. - Yeah. Dad aged well, didn't he?

532
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:04,020
He always said that he was one of the Kurlanders with good genes.

533
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:06,490
Here you go.

534
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:16,290
Oh, you were thirstier than Eva.

535
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,250
- Another one? - Oh, please.

536
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,460
And then I won't bother you again.

537
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,920
Oh, no, no. It's no bother at all.

538
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,250
Stay as long as you like.

539
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:31,090
Ever since, uh... since Dad died, it's been pretty lonely out here.

540
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:35,930
You know, I'm just driving around

541
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:41,190
doing my rounds, with nothing but the radio and the occasional dispatch.

542
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,110
It's good to have someone to talk to when I come home.

543
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,950
- Here's your water. - You're not married?

544
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:54,070
No, no. Have a seat. I was, you know, twice.

545
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:57,330
The first one, uh, took my house,

546
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:00,000
the second one left before...

547
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,960
...the quarry takes this one.

548
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:06,250
That was...Ooh, hell, seven years already.

549
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:08,590
I wouldn't mind getting another one,

550
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,430
but Bruneau ain't exactly the best singles scene

551
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:16,220
and, well, I ain't exactly the best single.

552
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:23,230
Did your father ever talk to you about Germany?

553
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,650
Are you kidding me?

554
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:27,980
He never stopped talking about Germany.

555
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,320
Did he ever speak to you about the war?

556
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:32,900
Of course.

557
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:35,070
You know he was a collector, right?

558
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,660
Ah.

559
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,200
I got a bunch of his stuff. You wanna go take a look?

560
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,160
Yeah.

561
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,670
Watch your step. Just come down here.

562
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,510
Eva, quiet! Eva, shh.

563
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,220
Hey, listen, uh, it's kind of a mess in here.

564
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:02,140
Let me just move some boxes and I'll...

565
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,020
I'll let you in the other room.

566
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:11,190
Here we go.

567
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,490
There we go. There. Come on. Oh!

568
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:17,700
Come on in.

569
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:27,670
That was, uh...that was Dad's pride and joy.

570
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:36,050
The dealer he bought it from swore it was flying in Berlin on November 19, 1938.

571
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,430
Kristallnacht.

572
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,180
Kristallnacht... Yeah.

573
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,600
Dad used to say that that flag, um,

574
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:50,730
witnessed the beginning of history.

575
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:53,230
You know?

576
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,620
- What is in these boxes?  - Uh, just...

577
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:05,620
a bunch more of Dad's prize pieces. You know?

578
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:08,080
I already sold most of the collection

579
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:13,590
but, uh, these are the things he was sentimental about.

580
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:19,340
Just haven't been able to let myself get rid of 'em, you know?

581
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,350
You wanna look around?

582
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,100
- Thank you. - Yeah.

583
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,200
Yeah, that was a first printing.

584
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,540
A guy offered me six grand for it but I just... just couldn't part with it.

585
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:53,290
I guess I'm just as sentimental as my old man, huh?

586
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,220
You're welcome to look around at... at anything you like.

587
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,640
I'm just gonna give Eva her dinner.

588
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:23,490
Quiet! Shh!

589
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:40,800
Priceless, right?

590
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,260
Yeah.

591
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:48,640
I guess I shouldn't leave it stuffed in a box like that.

592
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,330
You want another drink?

593
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,370
Yes. That would be good.

594
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,710
More water,or something a little stronger?

595
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,880
Maybe something a little stronger.

596
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:16,380
All right.

597
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,300
Now you're speaking my language.

598
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,720
Yeah...

599
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,470
To Dad.

600
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,900
You know, my dad was, uh...

601
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:37,440
My dad was there that night.

602
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,780
- What night was that? - Um, Kristal...

603
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,700
- Kristallnacht. - Yeah. Kristallnacht.

604
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:45,530
Yeah, he said he had a hammer

605
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,330
and he broke a bunch of jewelry store windows.

606
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:50,370
- He ever tell you that story? - No.

607
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,580
No?

608
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,500
I so wish you were here when he was still alive.

609
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:58,040
You know, every once in a while, some of his buddies would come by

610
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:01,630
and they'd just sit around, tell stories, drink, you know?

611
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:05,390
He loved to talk about the old days.

612
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,850
You okay? You're sweating there.

613
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,350
- Oh, I feel a little hot. Yes. - Well, take your jacket off.

614
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,640
Come here. Mmm.

615
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,650
Yeah, take your jacket off and, hey, I just want to tell you something.

616
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:19,480
- You are more than welcome... - Oh.

617
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:22,690
...to spend the night if you like, if you don't mind sleeping in dad's old bed.

618
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,820
- You're very kind. No, thank you.  - No, no.

619
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:27,910
- Well, all right, the offer's on the table. - Oh, thank you.

620
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,700
Any friend of Dad's is a friend of mine.

621
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:35,500
How'd you know him? Did you serve with my dad?

622
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,790
- No. - Well, how did you know him then?

623
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,630
I knew him from Auschwitz.

624
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,680
Auschwitz?

625
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,810
My dad wished he served at Auschwitz.

626
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:56,810
You mean your father was not at Auschwitz?

627
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:58,860
What are you...

628
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,520
Are you serious? My dad was a cook in the army.

629
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:13,450
I don't even know what that is. No, my dad was 10 when the war started.

630
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,370
Most that the Germans let him do was, you know,

631
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,250
break a bunch of windows and cook some Wiener Schnitzel, you know?

632
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:22,590
I am sorry to have bothered you.

633
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:27,010
- I have the wrong Rudy Kurlander. - No, no, no. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

634
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:30,890
Wait a minute, you were at Auschwitz?

635
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:33,470
- Oh. - None of my dad's buddies served at a camp.

636
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,560
I must leave you now. I have bothered you enough.

637
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,560
Bothered me? No, no, no. Please stay.

638
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:40,610
Please stay. Share some stories.

639
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:42,860
I'll grab another bottle. We'll just...

640
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:51,450
What's that?

641
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
What is that?

642
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:00,540
What the fuck is that?

643
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:04,710
Well... I'm sorry. I...

644
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,510
I, uh...

645
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,880
What the fuck is that?

646
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,890
Are you a Jew?

647
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,640
Yeah.

648
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,610
You're a Jew?

649
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,400
What the fuck's going on here?

650
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,570
I'm sorry, I...

651
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,450
Sit the fuck down.

652
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,740
Please, let me go.

653
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,540
What the fuck are you doing in my house?

654
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:44,920
I made a mistake. Your father is the wrong man.

655
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,340
My father?

656
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:51,510
You said you were a friend of my dad.

657
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:54,640
You lied to me.

658
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:59,350
- I did not lie. I did not lie! - Jesus fucking Christ.

659
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,940
You said you were a friend of my dad, you come into my house

660
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,610
and you drink my fucking whiskey,

661
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,650
and you're a dirty fucking Jew.

662
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,910
Eva, shut the fuck up!

663
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:16,450
Stop yelling! Please, stop yelling! I will go.

664
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:17,700
Sit the fuck down!

665
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,460
You gotta answer some questions right fucking now!

666
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,130
Holy shit! Did you just piss on my couch?

667
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:32,130
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - What the fuck?

668
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:33,470
Stop yelling!

669
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,550
Eva, shut the fuck up!

670
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,010
Are you giving me a fucking order, Jew?

671
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,480
Eva, I said, "Shut the fuck up!" You know...

672
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:46,480
you know what my dad would say if he knew a fucking Jew was in his house, huh?

673
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:49,570
He would say, "Heil fucking Hitler."

674
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:50,610
That's what he'd say. Yeah.

675
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:54,700
Heil fucking Hitler! Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!

676
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,950
Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler, you fucking Jew!

677
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,910
Eva, goddamn it, shut the fuck up!

678
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,660
Shut up! What's your problem?

679
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,160
Huh? Shut up!

680
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,040
Stop it! Eva, quiet!

681
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:07,750
Eva!

682
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:10,840
Damn it, shut up! Shut up, damn it! Quiet!

683
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,720
Eva, settle down.

684
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:19,060
You want to meet a real life fucking Jew?

685
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,520
Huh? Huh?

686
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,850
Huh? Go get him.

687
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:24,850
Ah!

688
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,020
What the...

689
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,200
You fucking kike!

690
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:35,610
You fucking...

691
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,790
Oh...

692
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:07,160
You've reached John Kurlander.

693
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:10,120
Leave me a message. Or if it's an emergency, call my cell phone.

694
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:11,630
Ruth?

695
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,000
Where you at, John? You're a half hour late

696
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:15,800
and I can't cover your ass all morning.

697
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,550
- I swear, you best be having car trouble... - What are you saying?

698
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
My God.

699
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,010
Oh...

700
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,720
Hello.

701
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:50,100
- Max, it's Zev. - Where have you been?

702
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:54,060
I killed a man.

703
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:57,230
Uh...

704
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:04,200
Now is the hardest part. You must call the police.

705
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:06,620
- You must... - No, no!

706
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:09,160
He was not the man we are looking for.

707
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:16,130
- Who was he? - It was a much younger man.

708
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:19,340
I, uh... I saw his name on a box.

709
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,880
It was John Kurlander.

710
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:24,300
He is a Nazi.

711
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:31,020
- How do you know this? - There were many Nazi things

712
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:33,100
- in the house. Many things. - Oh.

713
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:38,150
This is not what we set out to do.

714
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,280
Zev.

715
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,280
Do you want to continue?

716
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,120
Yes, I must finish.

717
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,120
I must.

718
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:54,960
After all, this is the man who killed our families.

719
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,120
Ruth?

720
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,040
Ruth?

721
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,040
Ruth!

722
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:44,020
Hello.

723
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:46,480
Yes.

724
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:53,910
Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you so much.

725
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:58,580
Is he okay?

726
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,120
No, he has dementia. Mm-hmm.

727
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:05,420
I'm sorry. Uh...

728
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:08,210
Where are you calling from? I can be there right away.

729
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:12,970
Reno Memorial Hospital?

730
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:15,430
- Reno, Nevada? - Reno?

731
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:18,600
Is it possible that I could speak with my father?

732
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,310
Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much.

733
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:28,110
Guys, I gotta sneeze.

734
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,080
Hello.

735
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:44,330
Oh, hello, Charles.

736
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,210
Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

737
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:50,550
Thank you.

738
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:54,010
I told the doctors not to bother you.

739
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:55,340
Huh?

740
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,220
Please, don't you worry about me.

741
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:02,180
No. No. No. Don't you come to the hospital.

742
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:04,480
Your mother will pick me up.

743
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:08,480
Maybe you come with her, huh?

744
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:14,150
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Goodbye. Goodbye.

745
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,370
Do you like cartoons?

746
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,130
I like Disney Channel.

747
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:31,130
- Mickey Mouse? - No. I like Phineas and Ferb.

748
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,550
Oh.

749
01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:34,260
I never heard of them.

750
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:36,390
I'll be right back, Molly.

751
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:39,930
You finish your homework please.

752
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:46,150
- Your name is Molly? - Molly Elizabeth.

753
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:50,020
Do you like sweets, Molly Elizabeth?

754
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,940
Well, uh...

755
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:57,990
I think there are some caramels in my coat pocket.

756
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:02,410
I always keep some there for my grandchildren.

757
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,040
Ah.

758
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:07,080
I can't find any.

759
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:12,050
Well, my wife will bring some when she comes.

760
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:21,510
- Are you Zev? - Yes.

761
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:24,020
Can I open your letter?

762
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:25,390
Uh-huh.

763
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,440
- Whoa, you're rich! - What?

764
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:44,040
Who's Max?

765
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,080
Max?

766
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:48,580
I'm not sure.

767
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:57,260
Wait. Why don't you read the letter to me out loud?

768
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:04,680
"Zev, there are some difficult things you must know."

769
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:10,100
"Firstly, Ruth has passed away."

770
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:12,650
"She had cancer."

771
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:18,780
"She loved you and you were with her, holding her hand, at the end."

772
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:24,620
"Secondly, you have dementia."

773
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:28,750
"Recently you have been forgetting many things."

774
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:33,130
That's normal. Old people always forget things.

775
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:34,630
Yeah. Yeah.

776
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:39,130
"You and I have a similar history."

777
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:43,260
"We are both Auschwitz..."

778
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:46,810
Auschwitz. Auschwitz.        "Auschwitz survivors."

779
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:53,270
"Look at your left arm, you were prisoner 98814."

780
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:03,200
"When the war ended,"

781
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:06,660
"I promised myself"

782
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:12,500
"I would find the men responsible."

783
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:17,300
"Working with Simon Wiesenthal,"

784
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:22,590
"I have helped to capture dozens of former Nazis"

785
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,100
"all around the world."

786
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:28,180
What's a Nazi?        Nazi. Nazi.

787
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,270
A bad person.

788
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:39,740
Six months ago, God smiled upon me

789
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:44,110
when you moved to the senior housing community.

790
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:48,870
I immediately recognized you from Auschwitz,

791
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:52,250
although you did not remember me.

792
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:59,420
We are the last living survivors from our prison block.

793
01:08:59,550 --> 01:09:03,430
Besides me, you are the only person

794
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:08,600
who could still recognize the face of the man who murdered our families.

795
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:13,270
Simon Wiesenthal insisted

796
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:17,270
that all war criminals be given public trials.

797
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:23,650
However, we cannot give Wallisch that opportunity.

798
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:27,240
Even if there was enough proof,

799
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:31,410
he, like us, would probably die

800
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:34,620
before he could be extradited to Germany.

801
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:41,840
We have agreed that Otto Wallisch must die.

802
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:46,180
You must kill him.

803
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:51,270
"You promised to go once Ruth died.

804
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:55,730
"You promised me and you promised Ruth."

805
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:01,780
You did a very good job.

806
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,360
Thanks.

807
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:07,610
Who's Ruth?

808
01:10:08,530 --> 01:10:09,530
My wife.

809
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:12,620
I thought she was bringing me candy.

810
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:15,370
I thought so, too.

811
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,510
Yes, I need to go to Holiday Inn Express

812
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:28,760
3961 Lake Tahoe Boulevard.

813
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,800
South Lake?         Yeah.

814
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:32,810
That's over an hour away.

815
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:37,520
Oh, that's... I have money.        Hop in.

816
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:00,500
Hello. Zev?        Yeah.

817
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,630
Thank God.

818
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,260
Where are you?

819
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:09,970
Zev?

820
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:11,850
Tahoe.

821
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:16,560
You understand what you must do

822
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:19,770
There's only one left.

823
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:23,610
Yeah, I understand...

824
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,610
what I must do.

825
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:36,910
Morning.        Good morning.

826
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,870
I'd like to check out, please.

827
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,500
Thank you.

828
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:45,300
You hurt your hand?        Oh, yes, yes.

829
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:47,800
It's... Well, I can move.        Good.

830
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,590
Okay, that'll be $106.20.

831
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:56,350
I think I will have enough money for the taxi.

832
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,400
Oh, uh, we take credit cards, too.

833
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:03,020
Yeah.

834
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:05,570
Thank you.

835
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:10,360
Tahoe? What the heck is he doing in Tahoe?

836
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:13,710
No, I'm just picking up a rental now

837
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:15,740
and I guess I'll just drive up there.

838
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:16,790
Yeah.

839
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:18,500
Oh, look, can you try and find

840
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:20,660
the name of the taxi company that picked him up?

841
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,420
Thank you.

842
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,470
Can I help you?

843
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:20,140
Rudy Kurlander, he lives here?

844
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:23,560
Yes.        Can I speak with him?

845
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,560
He's still sleeping.         Oh.

846
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:30,980
Well, could I wait for him to... wake up?

847
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:33,450
It's important.

848
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:35,660
What's this about?

849
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:37,870
Well, it's private.

850
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:39,490
And he knows me, he knows me.

851
01:13:39,490 --> 01:13:41,040
I knew him a long time ago.

852
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:46,500
Come on in.        Oh, thank you. Thank you.

853
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:52,590
Do you want a cup of coffee, Mr...        Guttman.

854
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:55,510
Yes, coffee would be nice. Thank you.

855
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:59,430
Uh, just black.        Take a seat in the living room.

856
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,850
I've got a pot brewing.

857
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,780
That's from our family reunion a couple years ago.

858
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:20,330
Oh.

859
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:22,160
You have a big family.

860
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:25,210
My father likes to say he fielded a soccer team.

861
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:26,920
I'm his youngest.

862
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,080
How old was your mother?

863
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:31,880
She was a lot younger. It was his second marriage.

864
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,550
Thank you.        Can I ask you a question, Mr. Guttman?

865
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:40,180
Does you being here have to do with Auschwitz?

866
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:43,100
Yes.

867
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,810
My father's not gonna want to talk about that.

868
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:48,230
Oh.

869
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,060
I understand.

870
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,740
Would you like to join us for breakfast, Mr. Guttman?

871
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:57,110
I'm making baked apple pancakes.

872
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,570
I'm not very hungry. Thank you very much.

873
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,240
I won't bother you for long.

874
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:04,830
Are you sure? It's an old family recipe.

875
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:08,750
Mmm. Yes, I am sure, but thank you just the same.

876
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,960
If you'd excuse me, I am just going to run up and tell Dad you're here.

877
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:13,500
Yeah, yeah.

878
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:35,900
Uh, who are you?

879
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:38,490
Oh, I am Zev.

880
01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:39,910
Hi, Zev.       Inge

881
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:46,290
Who is that?

882
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:51,080
Well, it's an old friend of your grandfather.

883
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:47,970
You like Wagner?

884
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:54,940
Yes. I have always loved Wagner.

885
01:16:55,900 --> 01:17:00,360
My daughter said someone I knew from Auschwitz was here.

886
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:04,700
But a survivor should not like Wagner, no?

887
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:07,990
You can't hate music.

888
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:14,210
I, uh, didn't recognize your face in those pictures.

889
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:16,710
But...

890
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:23,970
Your voice...

891
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:29,720
has not changed.

892
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,730
I knew you would come to find me one day.

893
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:40,400
Zev's your friend, Poppy?

894
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:43,240
Inge, please go back into the kitchen.

895
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,070
My friend and I need to discuss some things.

896
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,370
I have not forgotten you.

897
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:56,080
Please... let us go outside.

898
01:17:57,380 --> 01:18:01,050
I do not want my family to hear...what we have to say.

899
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:08,800
It has been a long time...

900
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:12,930
since anyone knew who I was.

901
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:17,350
I cannot even remember when.

902
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:24,280
Over the years people have looked at me

903
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:29,780
and I think they know, but they never do.

904
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:36,920
Or maybe they were just too scared to say anything.

905
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:45,300
Sometimes, I come out here and speak my name.

906
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,140
I talk to myself.

907
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:54,100
I remind myself of who I was.

908
01:18:57,350 --> 01:19:01,310
It is the only way to know I existed...

909
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:05,740
before I became who I am now.

910
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:13,200
Well, living a lie is not a life.

911
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,830
I always knew you would find me.

912
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,300
It has been too long.

913
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:28,970
We are old men now.

914
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:35,010
Take your hands off of me, Otto.

915
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:38,810
Excuse me?

916
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:42,060
I said, "Take your hands off of me."

917
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:47,440
You called me Otto.

918
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:49,110
I think you're confused.

919
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:53,240
No, your name is Otto Wallisch.

920
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:01,000
And you killed my family.

921
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:04,380
Are you crazy?

922
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:08,930
You've lived a lie for so long

923
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:12,340
you've convinced yourself it is true.

924
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:14,970
I...

925
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,100
I do not understand.

926
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:20,270
Let me help you...

927
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,150
understand.

928
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:36,200
It's like we're running a hotel.

929
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:40,000
Go tell Pop-Pop breakfast is ready.

930
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:45,710
Who is it?        My name's Charles Guttman.

931
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,590
I think my father's here.

932
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:50,470
Hi, I'm so sorry to bother you,

933
01:20:50,590 --> 01:20:54,800
but I was told that a taxi dropped my dad off here a little while ago.

934
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:56,970
Yeah, he's outside with my father.

935
01:20:58,430 --> 01:20:59,430
Thank God.

936
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,600
He's been missing for a week.

937
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:05,060
Missing?

938
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,610
I had no idea. Come on.        Thank you.

939
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:24,170
Dad?        Oh, my God.

940
01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:27,090
Mommy?        Please do not be frightened.

941
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:28,210
Don't be scared.

942
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:32,470
Dad, why don't you, uh, lower the gun?

943
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:35,090
Charles?        Yeah.

944
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:38,140
What are you doing here?       Uh...

945
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:40,640
Dad, put the gun down.

946
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:44,390
Put down the gun, Dad.        No. No.

947
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:47,150
Not until he tells the truth.

948
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,650
Why are you doing this?

949
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,240
Tell them who you are.

950
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:57,030
Please, stop this madness.

951
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,490
Tell them what you did.

952
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:02,370
Leave them alone, please.        English!

953
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:03,540
I beg you.

954
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:06,170
I want them to understand what you're saying.

955
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:08,250
Dad, what is he talking about?

956
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,670
Do not listen to him. He is crazy!

957
01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:13,670
Ach so?

958
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,220
You have a very easy choice.

959
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:21,260
You can tell the truth and she lives,

960
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:24,060
or you can lie and watch her die.

961
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:25,140
You have three seconds.

962
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:26,230
One.        Please stop.

963
01:22:26,350 --> 01:22:28,150
Two.        Please, just shoot me.

964
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:29,230
Dad, stop it!        Three.

965
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,400
Okay. Okay.

966
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:33,230
Okay.

967
01:22:42,370 --> 01:22:44,700
During the war,

968
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:48,170
I was not a prisoner.

969
01:22:48,710 --> 01:22:49,710
Louder.

970
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:54,670
During the war I was not a prisoner.        Louder!

971
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:58,720
During the war I was not a prisoner!

972
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:10,400
I was a Nazi.

973
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:15,440
I was SS.

974
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:22,410
Did you kill people?

975
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:24,580
Yes.

976
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:30,250
You killed people, Poppy?        How many people did you kill?

977
01:23:31,290 --> 01:23:32,290
I don't know.

978
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:34,500
Many.

979
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:40,430
And now tell them your real name.

980
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,270
My name is...

981
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:53,730
Kunibert Sturm.

982
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:55,730
No.

983
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:58,900
Your name is Wallisch!

984
01:23:59,030 --> 01:24:01,360
No, it's Kunibert Sturm.

985
01:24:01,490 --> 01:24:03,990
You are Otto Wallisch!

986
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,330
No.

987
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:10,710
You! You are Otto Wallisch!

988
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:16,090
You're lying.

989
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,510
No.

990
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:24,430
It's the first time I haven't lied in 70 years.

991
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:28,640
You are Otto Wallisch.

992
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:34,400
I am Kunibert Sturm. We were both Blockfhrers.

993
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,030
No...

994
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:39,440
I was a prisoner.

995
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:41,490
Look at your arm.

996
01:24:42,450 --> 01:24:47,120
You are number 98814. I am 98813.

997
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:54,540
We tattooed each other. It was our only way to escape.

998
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:11,810
Dad?

999
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:14,810
Is that true?

1000
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:19,150
No, it's all lies. It's all lies.

1001
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,650
It's not true.

1002
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:23,320
Lies?

1003
01:25:26,530 --> 01:25:28,120
How could you forget?

1004
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:32,460
You took the name Zev because it means wolf.

1005
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:36,880
You said we were wolves!

1006
01:25:47,550 --> 01:25:49,180
Oh, my God.

1007
01:26:03,150 --> 01:26:04,570
I remember.

1008
01:26:08,370 --> 01:26:09,370
Dad?

1009
01:26:12,330 --> 01:26:13,370
Dad!

1010
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:18,380
Right now, we're still waiting

1011
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,250
to hear from the Lake Tahoe Police Department.

1012
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:23,550
They haven't spoken to reporters or released a statement just yet.

1013
01:26:23,670 --> 01:26:24,740
But they have assured us

1014
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:27,800
that we will hear from them in some way within the hour.

1015
01:26:27,930 --> 01:26:31,510
Residents, though, are,as you can imagine, just stunned.

1016
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:35,230
I've spoken to some people who do not want to comment on camera.

1017
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:38,150
I did speak to one, though, who told me that...

1018
01:26:38,270 --> 01:26:42,610
Poor Zev.        Tragic. Absolutely tragic.

1019
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:45,280
He couldn't have known what he was doing.

1020
01:26:49,490 --> 01:26:52,330
He knew exactly what he was doing.

1021
01:26:54,370 --> 01:26:56,460
What? What are you talking about, Max?

1022
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:03,300
The man he killed

1023
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:08,970
was named Kunibert Sturm.

1024
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:13,640
And Zev's name

1025
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:19,520
was Otto Wallisch.

1026
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,230
They were the men who...

1027
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:30,450
murdered my family.
