-1

1
00:00:56,22 --> 00:00:58,43
- Peter, I'm so happy to see you. - Hi. How are you?

2
00:00:58,56 --> 00:01:00,77
- I'm wonderful. How are you? - Good, good.

3
00:01:00,89 --> 00:01:03,52
Is this a night for a party or what?

4
00:01:05,31 --> 00:01:07,98
- I mean, this huge mix-up-- - Okay, everyone.

5
00:01:08,11 --> 00:01:11,11
- I found his commercial. Come on in. - Oh, I can't wait to see it.

6
00:01:11,23 --> 00:01:13,40
Oh, he-- he can't weasel out of this one. We're gonna show it.

7
00:01:13,53 --> 00:01:15,82
It's show time, folks. Let's go.

8
00:01:15,95 --> 00:01:17,82
- Shh! Shh! Shh! - Hey, quiet!

9
00:01:17,95 --> 00:01:20,16
I came from fairly humble beginnings from upstate New York.

10
00:01:20,29 --> 00:01:23,12
- And to be honest, I'd never even been on an aeroplane before. - Nice make-up.

11
00:01:23,25 --> 00:01:26,33
Not until the Air Force taught me to fly in 1969.

12
00:01:26,46 --> 00:01:29,71
I ended up doing 28 combat missions for them.

13
00:01:29,84 --> 00:01:32,30
In, uh, 1971-- Oh, a tough year--

14
00:01:32,42 --> 00:01:34,38
I threw everything I owned into a charter service.

15
00:01:34,51 --> 00:01:36,38
- You look better than those frogs in that beer commercial. - When we kicked off...

16
00:01:36,51 --> 00:01:40,35
we had a six-seater and one DC-3, and we would fly anywhere.

17
00:01:40,47 --> 00:01:42,39
We were like the yellow cabs of the sky.

18
00:01:42,52 --> 00:01:47,48
In 1979, we started Endeavor, and we only flew to four different cities.

19
00:01:47,60 --> 00:01:51,73
But, uh, I think the passengers picked up on my, my joy in flying.

20
00:01:51,86 --> 00:01:54,65
And we've grown to 37 countries worldwide.

21
00:01:54,78 --> 00:01:56,86
We're still pretty small in the scheme of things.

22
00:01:56,99 --> 00:01:59,57
But then, I never wanted to be the biggest, just the best.

23
00:01:59,70 --> 00:02:04,20
The most important thing to me these days: family.

24
00:02:04,33 --> 00:02:06,50
Mine. Yours.

25
00:02:06,62 --> 00:02:08,50
That's the good thing about an airline.

26
00:02:08,63 --> 00:02:11,09
It actually brings families closer together, among other things.

27
00:02:11,21 --> 00:02:15,51
And that makes me feel good. 1971. Man.

28
00:02:15,63 --> 00:02:19,84
I had the devil in me back then. But today-- people change.

29
00:02:21,97 --> 00:02:24,31
Sort of.

30
00:02:27,48 --> 00:02:30,19
- He really didn't want to do it. - I thought he was great.

31
00:02:30,31 --> 00:02:34,40
- He was good. - Author! - Where did he go?

32
00:02:34,53 --> 00:02:36,40
Okay, get it over with, you pack of freeloaders.

33
00:02:36,53 --> 00:02:38,78
- Put it there. I got big shoulders. - When's it air?

34
00:02:38,91 --> 00:02:40,62
I was afraid to ask, actually. No, you're too kind. No, you're too kind.

35
00:02:40,74 --> 00:02:43,03
Actually, I'm contemplating suicide before it airs.

36
00:02:43,16 --> 00:02:45,12
Oh, yes, of course. Because he's so shy.

37
00:02:45,25 --> 00:02:48,21
And next month, he's doing the underwear billboard in Times Square. Ow!

38
00:03:25,41 --> 00:03:27,29
You should have seen-- You should have seen the look on his face.

39
00:03:27,41 --> 00:03:29,29
He couldn't figure out where I got that information.

40
00:03:29,41 --> 00:03:31,71
- And where did you? - I took safe-cracking at MIT.

41
00:03:31,83 --> 00:03:34,25
- No, the guy couldn't believe it. - Hey, Sean, you eat something?

42
00:03:34,38 --> 00:03:36,09
- You okay? - Yeah. - Good.

43
00:03:36,21 --> 00:03:38,42
You know, the guy's a wacko. I mean, seriously, he's, like, whoo!

44
00:03:38,55 --> 00:03:41,26
- Unbelievable, unbelievable. - What I can't figure out is how someone expects you to bite...

45
00:03:41,38 --> 00:03:43,76
without expecting you to know everything about his business.

46
00:03:43,89 --> 00:03:47,89
- I agree. - Yeah. Anyway, uh, David's on the carpet.

47
00:04:14,38 --> 00:04:16,75
- All right, time to fold the tent, fella. Come on. - Tom?

48
00:04:16,88 --> 00:04:19,17
- Yeah? - Where did you get the tile in the kitchen? It's great.

49
00:04:19,30 --> 00:04:21,26
Oh, God, Louisa, that's a Kate question.

50
00:04:21,38 --> 00:04:25,01
See, I only answer Tom questions like, uh, you know, what's wrong with my chain saw?

51
00:04:25,14 --> 00:04:28,81
- What's the best time of day to kill a grizzly bear? - I have a perfect Tom question.

52
00:04:28,93 --> 00:04:31,43
How do you feel about Jackie Brown filing a civil suit against you...

53
00:04:31,56 --> 00:04:34,65
from his prison cell?

54
00:04:34,77 --> 00:04:38,48
Sean, why don't you, uh, brush, get ready. I'll be down in a minute. David, would you get Bob, please?

55
00:04:38,61 --> 00:04:41,69
- And you are? - I'm just givin' you heads-up because this Brown guy now says...

56
00:04:41,82 --> 00:04:45,28
that he has proof that you paid him to head off the machinists' strike.

57
00:04:45,41 --> 00:04:47,37
Well, that's not novel. I mean, he's been saying that for months.

58
00:04:47,49 --> 00:04:51,45
I know, I know. But now he says he has proof that you even initiated the bribe.

59
00:04:51,58 --> 00:04:54,67
I'm Sammy Adler from the Daily News. I just thought if we could spend a couple seconds--

60
00:04:54,79 --> 00:04:58,21
- Oh, oh, Bob Stone, Sammy Adams from the Daily News. Uh-- - Adler.

61
00:04:58,34 --> 00:05:00,46
- Why don't you make sure he gets home safe? - Can we get-- Can we do something for two seconds?

62
00:05:00,59 --> 00:05:03,47
- I hope you had a good time here. Drive safely. - All right, all right.

63
00:05:03,59 --> 00:05:05,18
- We're very civil here. - Guys, I'm a reporter. All right?

64
00:05:05,30 --> 00:05:07,26
- We know who you are. - I'm not a stalker, guys.

65
00:05:07,39 --> 00:05:10,14
Listen, your boss is gonna have to deal with this. Jackie Brown says he was set up.

66
00:05:10,27 --> 00:05:12,06
I think you gotta find someone else to talk to.

67
00:05:12,18 --> 00:05:14,77
- He's in the clear, you understand, Sammy? - Listen, if I was--

68
00:05:27,16 --> 00:05:29,95
- I came from humble-- - Cut. - Sean?

69
00:05:30,08 --> 00:05:31,95
- Okay, try it again. - About four cities, but l--

70
00:05:32,08 --> 00:05:34,91
- Sean? - But people picked on my-- - Oh, I guess he's not here.

71
00:05:35,04 --> 00:05:39,25
So I'll lie down and take a nap while I wait for him to turn up.

72
00:05:39,38 --> 00:05:42,13
God, this mattress is lumpy. And damned noisy too.

73
00:05:42,26 --> 00:05:45,63
And it's got hair and-- what? This mattress needs to be tickled!

74
00:05:45,76 --> 00:05:47,43
No laughing. No laughing allowed.

75
00:05:47,55 --> 00:05:49,43
And why are you watching my goof-ups again?

76
00:05:49,55 --> 00:05:51,51
- What is this bug in the-- Sorry. - Cut.

77
00:05:51,64 --> 00:05:54,56
- That's funny. - Yeah? Well, must make you feel good inside...

78
00:05:54,68 --> 00:05:56,60
to know your old man can't even talk.

79
00:05:56,73 --> 00:05:59,77
Grobe? A shrinking grobe?

80
00:05:59,90 --> 00:06:02,19
Was that guy mad at you upstairs?

81
00:06:02,32 --> 00:06:06,78
No. He's, uh, not mad. He's, uh, he's curious. Yeah.

82
00:06:06,91 --> 00:06:11,99
- It's his job, you know. He's gotta-- - It seems like someone's always mad at you.

83
00:06:12,12 --> 00:06:14,95
- That the way that seems? - Mm-hmm.

84
00:06:16,92 --> 00:06:21,29
Well, I guess that-- You're not mad at me, are you?

85
00:06:21,42 --> 00:06:24,96
- No. - Well, I can-- I can fix that.

86
00:06:26,76 --> 00:06:29,22
- A knuckle sandwich before bedtime. - Stop it! Stop it!

87
00:06:29,34 --> 00:06:31,51
I said get your ass movin'!

88
00:06:31,64 --> 00:06:34,14
- Get on the car! Shut the fuck up! - I ain't do nothin'! - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

89
00:06:34,27 --> 00:06:36,31
- Shut up, Romeo. - Calm down. Joey! Joey! Take it easy. Take--

90
00:06:36,43 --> 00:06:39,23
- Get him outta here. - A fuckin' track star, huh?

91
00:06:39,35 --> 00:06:41,77
- You little faggot. - Faggot? What?

92
00:06:41,90 --> 00:06:44,36
- You're lucky I don't put one in your back, you fuck! - Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

93
00:06:44,48 --> 00:06:46,53
- All right? You all right? - I'm all right. - All right.

94
00:06:46,65 --> 00:06:49,53
Honey, you better work the door. I think the Mayor wants to leave.

95
00:06:49,66 --> 00:06:51,66
Oh, thank God. You okay?

96
00:06:51,78 --> 00:06:53,79
- Yeah. - Good.

97
00:06:53,91 --> 00:06:56,25
Okay, did you brush your teeth?

98
00:06:56,37 --> 00:06:59,58
-I brushed them this morning. -No, no, no. We're gonna brush them now.

99
00:07:09,55 --> 00:07:12,72
45-Adam to Central-K. 207 West 30th Street.

100
00:07:12,85 --> 00:07:16,81
- Two unidentified suspects-- - Hey, hey. What are they, mink?

101
00:07:16,93 --> 00:07:18,81
Yeah, why? You wanna buy one? Take a walk.

102
00:07:25,48 --> 00:07:28,28
Oh, God. I'm beat.

103
00:07:28,40 --> 00:07:31,91
So where was that guy from? Daily News?

104
00:07:32,03 --> 00:07:35,87
- Does it make a difference? - Ohh! I'd like to kill those bastards.

105
00:07:35,99 --> 00:07:39,29
When they come after you, they come after us.

106
00:07:40,62 --> 00:07:43,54
It's freezing.

107
00:07:43,67 --> 00:07:46,71
- Oh, God. - I'd like to come after the contractor.

108
00:07:46,84 --> 00:07:49,17
- Yeah, well, you gotta find him first. - Yeah, really.

109
00:07:49,30 --> 00:07:54,14
It's freezing in here. Oh, that feels good.

110
00:07:54,26 --> 00:07:56,51
Don't let those guys get to you, okay?

111
00:07:56,64 --> 00:07:59,35
- Yeah. - That's what they want.

112
00:08:02,90 --> 00:08:04,73
I just wanna say

113
00:08:04,86 --> 00:08:07,19
Singin' makes me feel so fine

114
00:08:07,32 --> 00:08:11,20
Drivin' in my truck, man I'm always on the go

115
00:08:11,32 --> 00:08:14,62
Makin' my deliveries from here to Tupelo

116
00:08:14,74 --> 00:08:16,62
- Tupelo - But singin' bass--

117
00:08:16,74 --> 00:08:21,41
Okay, now I'd like to introduce to you the person responsible for this wonderful event.

118
00:08:21,54 --> 00:08:26,38
Uh, a fantastic lady. In fact, chairlady of the Junior Science Fair...

119
00:08:26,50 --> 00:08:29,01
Mrs Katherine Mullen.

120
00:08:29,13 --> 00:08:31,17
- All right! Yea! - Thank you.

121
00:08:32,47 --> 00:08:35,18
Thank you. Thank you, Mayor.

122
00:08:35,30 --> 00:08:39,39
And welcome to the tenth annual New York City Junior Science Fair.

123
00:08:41,94 --> 00:08:44,60
We have 54 young inventors competing today...

124
00:08:44,73 --> 00:08:47,69
- representing 22 schools-- - Dad? - Yeah? - Why can't I enter?

125
00:08:47,82 --> 00:08:50,28
Well, it wouldn't be fair, Sean. Your mother's a judge here.

126
00:08:50,40 --> 00:08:56,37
- And, uh, how would that look if you won? - Why don't I enter under a different name?

127
00:08:56,49 --> 00:08:59,87
- What, you mean, like John Smith? - No. Like Professor X.

128
00:08:59,99 --> 00:09:03,33
Well, I don't think you'd get away with that, Professor X.

129
00:09:03,46 --> 00:09:07,25
I mean, you're too young to have a degree. You got to be bald, have an eye patch. You know.

130
00:09:07,38 --> 00:09:10,88
No, better. Professor von X.

131
00:09:11,01 --> 00:09:14,05
And the third judge, I regret to say, is myself, Katherine Mullen...

132
00:09:14,18 --> 00:09:17,60
Events Chair for the 125th Anniversary of Central Park...

133
00:09:17,72 --> 00:09:21,72
and former teacher of biology at Evander Childs High School.

134
00:09:23,35 --> 00:09:25,77
So let the games begin.

135
00:09:25,90 --> 00:09:28,69
Our judges will now begin circulating.

136
00:09:28,82 --> 00:09:32,03
- So all of our inventors should be with their booths. - Wow. Destination: Yonkers.

137
00:09:32,15 --> 00:09:36,24
That's gotta be the best project out here. Don't you think it's gonna win?

138
00:09:36,36 --> 00:09:39,91
- Whoa! - Oh, look, there's me!

139
00:09:40,03 --> 00:09:42,20
Yeah, the wind is taking it. Down left rudder.

140
00:09:42,33 --> 00:09:46,92
Remember, we're going to want all of today's winners on stage at 1:00 to receive their award.

141
00:09:47,04 --> 00:09:49,59
- Good luck, everybody. - It's not fair, Dad. I worked really hard.

142
00:09:49,71 --> 00:09:53,21
I know. I know you worked really hard, and you did an amazing job.

143
00:09:53,34 --> 00:09:55,63
- But we talked about this before, didn't we, Sean? - Yes.

144
00:09:55,76 --> 00:09:59,43
Okay? Come on. Lighten up a little. Enjoy the day.

145
00:09:59,55 --> 00:10:02,31
- Okay. - Anyone else that has not registered... - Tom!

146
00:10:02,43 --> 00:10:05,27
- Hey! - Hey, how are you? - must have their registration cards in right now.

147
00:10:05,39 --> 00:10:07,40
This is your last chance.

148
00:10:11,23 --> 00:10:15,78
- P.S. 41. - Okay, P.S. 41. Yeah.

149
00:10:15,90 --> 00:10:19,16
Solar system here? And this big guy here is what?

150
00:10:19,28 --> 00:10:21,45
- The sun. - Okay.

151
00:10:21,58 --> 00:10:23,45
- And how many planets do we have around it? - Nine.

152
00:10:23,58 --> 00:10:25,96
- Nine. - I see Mars.

153
00:10:26,08 --> 00:10:29,38
Okay, folks, we'd like to thank the Friends of Central Park...

154
00:10:29,50 --> 00:10:33,59
and Mayor Barresi for allowing this event...

155
00:10:33,71 --> 00:10:38,30
to take place here at the beautiful Bethesda Fountain.

156
00:10:38,43 --> 00:10:42,31
- And a special thanks to our-- - Hey, Katie, look at the blimp.

157
00:10:42,43 --> 00:10:44,18
- Me too. - Looking forward to it.

158
00:10:44,31 --> 00:10:47,19
...for ten years strong. Lisa?

159
00:10:51,44 --> 00:10:57,03
Well, folks, there's still a few of those souvenir science fair T-shirts left.

160
00:11:05,79 --> 00:11:08,16
- She's incredible. I mean, the work she's put into this. - Yeah.

161
00:11:08,29 --> 00:11:12,17
Well, I don't know where she gets the energy.

162
00:11:12,29 --> 00:11:14,71
- And who is this orange guy over here? - That's Venus.

163
00:11:14,84 --> 00:11:17,67
That's Venus. Where's Earth?

164
00:11:17,80 --> 00:11:21,72
- Earth is this one. - There's Earth.

165
00:11:21,85 --> 00:11:27,60
Mr Vincent Barnes, we have not received your class's registration cards for Curtis High School--

166
00:11:27,73 --> 00:11:29,69
For the workshop.

167
00:11:29,81 --> 00:11:33,31
- See Mrs Moran at the exhibit. - Excuse me for a minute.

168
00:11:38,15 --> 00:11:40,53
Sean?

169
00:11:47,16 --> 00:11:49,25
Sean?

170
00:11:49,37 --> 00:11:53,04
Brooklyn, Queens to my left, Bronx, Manhattan and Staten lsland to my right.

171
00:11:53,17 --> 00:11:57,05
- You're it. - We ask you to stay with your boroughs.

172
00:11:57,17 --> 00:11:59,09
- Teachers, please keep a head count. - Sean.

173
00:11:59,22 --> 00:12:01,72
What do you think, Kate?

174
00:12:01,84 --> 00:12:03,80
Kate?

175
00:12:03,93 --> 00:12:07,72
- Kate. The score. - I-l-l scored it.

176
00:12:12,52 --> 00:12:14,40
Sean?

177
00:12:16,94 --> 00:12:19,24
Sean?

178
00:12:25,16 --> 00:12:26,58
Sean?

179
00:12:46,22 --> 00:12:49,97
- Cassandra, have you seen Sean? - No. Kate, are you all right?

180
00:12:50,10 --> 00:12:51,98
Okay.

181
00:12:56,86 --> 00:12:59,48
Sean.

182
00:12:59,61 --> 00:13:05,24
Sean. Sean Mullen, please come to the judge's stand.

183
00:13:37,48 --> 00:13:39,94
Sean?

184
00:13:47,53 --> 00:13:49,62
Oh, please, God.

185
00:13:49,74 --> 00:13:53,71
He's probably just bustin' chops, you know, 'cause we wouldn't let him enter the contest.

186
00:13:53,83 --> 00:13:55,71
Who didn't we call?

187
00:13:57,96 --> 00:14:01,46
- Sean? - You have E-mail.

188
00:14:13,31 --> 00:14:15,98
- I have your son. - Oh, Jesus!

189
00:14:16,10 --> 00:14:18,90
- I want $2 million in fifties and hundreds. - Oh, God!

190
00:14:19,02 --> 00:14:21,94
No consecutive serial numbers.

191
00:14:22,07 --> 00:14:24,24
No new bills. No marked bills.

192
00:14:24,36 --> 00:14:29,91
The money will fit into two Samsonite hard-shell suitcases, model #260.

193
00:14:30,03 --> 00:14:34,83
Do not involve the police or the FBl. If you do, I will kill him.

194
00:14:34,95 --> 00:14:38,37
Do not inform the media, or I will kill him.

195
00:14:38,50 --> 00:14:43,96
No tracking devices in the money or the cases, or I will kill him.

196
00:14:44,09 --> 00:14:48,84
You have 48 hours to get the money. I will contact you.

197
00:14:55,98 --> 00:14:59,02
Open your mouth. Open your mou-- Would you open your mouth now?

198
00:14:59,15 --> 00:15:02,52
Open it. Swallow it.

199
00:15:03,82 --> 00:15:06,03
You little prick.

200
00:15:11,24 --> 00:15:14,24
- What are you doing? - Why don't you just clean your shirt?

201
00:15:14,37 --> 00:15:16,62
Look, we talked about this.

202
00:15:16,75 --> 00:15:19,29
Oh, yeah. Forgot.

203
00:15:29,05 --> 00:15:31,18
Bitch.

204
00:15:32,10 --> 00:15:35,14
Kate. Kate! Who are you calling? He said no police.

205
00:15:35,27 --> 00:15:37,27
- Why did you do that? Why did you do that? - He said he'd kill him if you called the police.

206
00:15:37,39 --> 00:15:38,56
- I can have the money inside 3 hours. - Why did you leave him?

207
00:15:38,69 --> 00:15:40,56
- Why did you leave him? - I didn't.

208
00:15:40,69 --> 00:15:44,40
I saw you. You walked away.

209
00:15:47,32 --> 00:15:49,20
All right.

210
00:15:52,70 --> 00:15:54,91
- All right, I'm calling the police. - Call the FBl.

211
00:15:55,03 --> 00:15:58,04
- For Christ's sake, just let me pay this bastard. - Tom, please, call the FBl.

212
00:15:58,16 --> 00:16:00,92
Kate, the FBI just spent three months trying to bury us.

213
00:16:01,04 --> 00:16:04,59
- Do you think they give a good goddam about you or me or-- - Tom, they know us.

214
00:16:04,71 --> 00:16:07,59
They know us. Please.

215
00:16:09,63 --> 00:16:11,05
All right.

216
00:16:13,85 --> 00:16:17,31
- Lennon Paints. - Wait. What? What? - We're the painters.

217
00:16:17,43 --> 00:16:20,44
Yeah, we're goin' to the Mullen apartment. Uh, we're just finishin' work on the library.

218
00:16:20,56 --> 00:16:23,27
Oh, yes. Yeah. I get this call. Go ahead. Okay.

219
00:16:25,65 --> 00:16:29,07
- Behind you. - Mr and Mrs Mullen are waiting for you. - Thank you.

220
00:16:29,19 --> 00:16:32,36
Uh, Mr Mullen, how are you? Lonnie. Hawkins.

221
00:16:32,49 --> 00:16:35,70
-Uh, we got Kimba Welch, Jack Sickler... -How do you do? -How are you, sir?

222
00:16:35,83 --> 00:16:38,24
- David Levin, Ron Lambert. - How do you do?

223
00:16:38,37 --> 00:16:40,75
- Find the phone panel. - Fatima, could you show these gentlemen everything they want to know?

224
00:16:40,87 --> 00:16:44,88
- Paul. - Who's sweepin'?

225
00:16:45,00 --> 00:16:46,79
- And this is Paul Rhodes. - How do you do?

226
00:16:46,92 --> 00:16:50,72
- Hi. How you doing? - This here is as close as we could get to a look-alike.

227
00:16:50,84 --> 00:16:54,47
- Oh, I see. - Now, look, Mr Mullen, I'm not allowed to advise you on this...

228
00:16:54,59 --> 00:16:57,14
- but if you decide to pay the money-- - It's here. It's right over here.

229
00:16:58,77 --> 00:17:01,35
- This the money? - Yeah, $2 million.

230
00:17:01,48 --> 00:17:05,23
- Well, Paul here can make the drop for you. - Sure, sure.

231
00:17:05,36 --> 00:17:07,23
- Tom? - Yeah, David?

232
00:17:07,36 --> 00:17:09,23
- Bob's got some stuff for you right here. - Tom, this is all I could get...

233
00:17:09,36 --> 00:17:11,95
- from the National Center for Missing Children. - Good, good.

234
00:17:12,07 --> 00:17:14,61
- Uh, Agent Hawkins, this is David Torres. - Pleased to meet you.

235
00:17:14,74 --> 00:17:17,70
- What about the electric files? - Where's your phone panel, Mrs Mullen?

236
00:17:17,83 --> 00:17:20,29
- I-l have no idea. - That's okay. We'll find it.

237
00:17:20,41 --> 00:17:25,71
You know, what I don't understand is these people-- this he, she, it, whoever--

238
00:17:25,83 --> 00:17:29,30
has got enough brains to snatch my son right from under my nose...

239
00:17:29,42 --> 00:17:31,30
but they only ask me for $2 million.

240
00:17:31,42 --> 00:17:36,09
- Don't they know what I'm worth? - No, no. He's being smart, okay?

241
00:17:36,22 --> 00:17:38,51
Keepin' it nice and simple for you.

242
00:17:38,64 --> 00:17:42,18
Now, he knows you got it. Knows you won't have a problem coughin' it up.

243
00:17:42,31 --> 00:17:44,98
Maybe, uh, that's all he needs.

244
00:17:46,44 --> 00:17:49,02
Uh, uh, can l-- can I just, uh--

245
00:17:51,32 --> 00:17:54,15
Look, the-the reason you're here and not the police...

246
00:17:54,28 --> 00:17:57,57
is that we, my wife and l, we believe that this might be somehow connected...

247
00:17:57,70 --> 00:18:01,70
- with the, uh, machinists' union indictments. - Okay.

248
00:18:01,83 --> 00:18:04,71
So, uh, Jackie Brown.

249
00:18:04,83 --> 00:18:06,92
The man was caught on tape takin' a pay-off...

250
00:18:07,04 --> 00:18:10,38
during contract negotiations with another airline, uh, lnfinite Air.

251
00:18:10,50 --> 00:18:13,17
It was a sting, okay? So there he is, dead in the water.

252
00:18:13,30 --> 00:18:15,55
He says to your people, "Can we do something here?"

253
00:18:15,68 --> 00:18:18,89
And, uh, so he offers me up.

254
00:18:19,01 --> 00:18:20,89
Yeah, he said Tom gave him a quarter of a million dollars...

255
00:18:21,01 --> 00:18:23,02
for a sweetheart deal with the union.

256
00:18:23,14 --> 00:18:29,31
Now, I have been investigated exhaustively; me, my company, my-my family. My family.

257
00:18:29,44 --> 00:18:33,65
We've been dragged through the tabloid mud, courtesy of FBI leaks, and nothing. All right? Nothing.

258
00:18:33,78 --> 00:18:37,24
Now Jackie Brown's in jail where he belongs, and he's pissed, and I think he's got some pretty unsavoury associates out there.

259
00:18:37,36 --> 00:18:41,33
- Uh, Mr Mullen, obviously we're very aware of the Jackie Brown situation, Mr Mull-- - An-And?

260
00:18:41,45 --> 00:18:44,41
- We're still working on it. - Jesus Christ, I think you should pay a little more attention.

261
00:18:44,54 --> 00:18:46,75
- We're paying-- No. Can I make a suggestion, Mr Mullen? - What? What?

262
00:18:46,87 --> 00:18:50,92
Now, we are going to get into all of this in time, but for now, just hang loose.

263
00:18:51,04 --> 00:18:54,21
- Just sit tight so we can get a plan-- - Hang loose? Hang loose? Sit tight? Which one?

264
00:18:54,34 --> 00:18:56,67
Tom, just let him finish.

265
00:18:56,80 --> 00:19:00,01
- No, it's okay. It's okay. No, look, look. - I'm sorry.

266
00:19:00,14 --> 00:19:02,93
If this were my child, I'd be the same way. Believe me.

267
00:19:03,06 --> 00:19:05,52
It's not a problem at all.

268
00:19:16,69 --> 00:19:18,95
All right, kid, I know this is hard on you, all right?

269
00:19:19,95 --> 00:19:22,95
But you gotta hang in there.

270
00:19:26,75 --> 00:19:30,54
- How many kidnappings have you worked before? - All together, 33.

271
00:19:30,67 --> 00:19:34,80
Uh, now you take away the custodial, gang, drug-related, I've worked ten.

272
00:19:34,92 --> 00:19:39,01
Now, that's ten traditional, ransom-oriented abductions in the last five years.

273
00:19:39,13 --> 00:19:42,85
Now, that's a lot. Believe it or not, this kind of thing is kind of rare.

274
00:19:42,97 --> 00:19:46,77
Well, um, out of the ten, how many did you get back?

275
00:19:46,89 --> 00:19:48,77
Got back seven.

276
00:19:50,65 --> 00:19:54,69
Well, the others. What, um, went wrong?

277
00:19:54,82 --> 00:19:58,90
Oh, life. What we call the "X" factor.

278
00:19:59,03 --> 00:20:01,53
What's the "X" factor? What is that?

279
00:20:01,66 --> 00:20:03,53
- Are we set? - No!

280
00:20:03,66 --> 00:20:06,24
Shit, Jack!

281
00:20:06,37 --> 00:20:08,91
Any demands that come up, now, you just agree.

282
00:20:09,04 --> 00:20:12,42
Let him know he's in charge. Your only priority is getting your boy back.

283
00:20:12,54 --> 00:20:15,42
Get your boy back. You follow me?

284
00:20:15,55 --> 00:20:17,42
Now, you've got to give us some time, Mr Mullen.

285
00:20:17,55 --> 00:20:19,84
You ask to speak to your son. Ask for some sign that he's alive.

286
00:20:19,97 --> 00:20:24,80
Any information you can get. Then tell him he has an allergy, he has, uh, some medical condition.

287
00:20:24,93 --> 00:20:28,73
You want to know what kind of weather is he in. Is he indoors? ls he outdoors?

288
00:20:28,85 --> 00:20:30,98
- Are we set? - Go!

289
00:20:31,10 --> 00:20:33,40
- Get your boy back. - Okay.

290
00:20:36,65 --> 00:20:39,53
Hello?

291
00:20:42,74 --> 00:20:44,66
Cancel it.

292
00:20:44,78 --> 00:20:49,95
We got it. Brenda Chance, 4108 Utopia Parkway.

293
00:20:51,08 --> 00:20:53,08
That's his secretary.

294
00:20:53,21 --> 00:20:55,54
Yeah, we know.

295
00:21:04,01 --> 00:21:07,39
Is our son dead?

296
00:21:07,51 --> 00:21:09,39
Don't ever think that.

297
00:21:30,87 --> 00:21:33,75
Open your mouth. It's all right. It's food.

298
00:21:36,38 --> 00:21:42,09
So, why can't you starve in the desert?

299
00:21:44,55 --> 00:21:47,05
'Cause of all the sandwiches there.

300
00:21:58,06 --> 00:22:00,53
What are you doin'?

301
00:22:01,65 --> 00:22:05,07
What the--

302
00:22:05,20 --> 00:22:08,28
- Voters on Manhattan's East Side... - What are you thinkin'?

303
00:22:08,41 --> 00:22:10,29
- will be headed to the polls tomorrow-- - What the hell is going on?

304
00:22:10,41 --> 00:22:12,33
I was tellin' the kid a joke. What's the big deal?

305
00:22:12,45 --> 00:22:16,12
You like this kid? You wanna get to know him? Get a little relationship goin'?

306
00:22:16,25 --> 00:22:18,59
You think that's gonna make things easier or harder?

307
00:22:18,71 --> 00:22:21,71
- Make what easier, Maris? - Is he for real?

308
00:22:21,84 --> 00:22:23,97
- Yeah, I'm for real, bitch. Are you for real? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

309
00:22:24,09 --> 00:22:27,51
Whoa! Whoa. Why don't you just back off, all right?

310
00:22:27,64 --> 00:22:29,55
You step up, and I'll back off.

311
00:22:31,39 --> 00:22:34,14
Come here.

312
00:22:34,27 --> 00:22:37,06
Listen to me. Look.

313
00:22:38,81 --> 00:22:41,32
With the candy bars and shit--

314
00:22:43,11 --> 00:22:47,32
It's just that you might be makin' beds in a burnin' house.

315
00:22:48,70 --> 00:22:51,83
You understand what I'm sayin'?

316
00:22:51,95 --> 00:22:55,08
Yeah, but, Clark, man, the kid's in a cocoon.

317
00:22:55,21 --> 00:22:57,87
And he can't ID anybody.

318
00:22:58,00 --> 00:23:00,84
What the hell he's supposed to tell 'em?

319
00:23:07,59 --> 00:23:11,01
Wait a goddam second, man. Clark, you never said nothin' to me about killin' no kids!

320
00:23:11,14 --> 00:23:13,43
Do you understand what is goin' on now?

321
00:23:13,56 --> 00:23:16,35
You do not joke with this kid. You don't play with him. You don't talk to him.

322
00:23:16,48 --> 00:23:18,35
- Don't talk to my brother, all right? - He is not your pet.

323
00:23:18,48 --> 00:23:20,40
- This is real. - You don't gotta talk to my brother, all right?

324
00:23:20,52 --> 00:23:23,48
You got nothin' to say to him. Who do you think you are? What do you--

325
00:23:23,61 --> 00:23:26,36
- You think you're runnin' shit here? - No, I'm not runnin' shit. My man is runnin' shit.

326
00:23:26,49 --> 00:23:28,86
- Oh. Your man. Right. - But if I have a problem, I'm going to address it.

327
00:23:28,99 --> 00:23:31,28
- Yeah, I understand. All right. - I gotta tell you, boys.

328
00:23:31,41 --> 00:23:34,33
She's scarin' the bejeepers outta me.

329
00:23:34,45 --> 00:23:37,25
- And you're fuckin' drinkin' again. - Well, that's okay, though...

330
00:23:37,37 --> 00:23:40,50
see, 'cause I haven't been drinkin' with the kid.

331
00:23:43,67 --> 00:23:47,38
I have to tell you something that I think you should know.

332
00:23:47,51 --> 00:23:49,05
Okay.

333
00:23:53,30 --> 00:23:55,01
I paid him off.

334
00:23:55,14 --> 00:24:00,19
You understand I'm not a priest. I'm not a psychiatrist. I'm not a lawyer.

335
00:24:00,31 --> 00:24:03,44
Tom, this is not a protected conversation.

336
00:24:03,57 --> 00:24:05,61
I understand.

337
00:24:05,73 --> 00:24:08,74
See, most guys at the top, they've acquired their airline.

338
00:24:08,86 --> 00:24:12,20
But not me, no, I built Endeavor from the ground up.

339
00:24:12,32 --> 00:24:15,99
And it's mine, and no bastard's takin' it away from me.

340
00:24:16,12 --> 00:24:19,91
No union, no government, no gangster like Jackie Brown.

341
00:24:20,04 --> 00:24:21,83
I initiated the bribe. I had a business to run.

342
00:24:21,96 --> 00:24:24,25
I had 2,000 employees, God knows how many customers...

343
00:24:24,38 --> 00:24:27,84
and I didn't have time for a goddam machinists' strike.

344
00:24:27,96 --> 00:24:34,47
So, after what I did-- what I proposed and, and carried out--

345
00:24:36,18 --> 00:24:38,27
he's in jail and I'm not.

346
00:24:38,39 --> 00:24:43,31
So my question to you is: Did Jackie Brown take my son?

347
00:24:44,61 --> 00:24:46,36
Do you wanna go ask him?

348
00:25:19,68 --> 00:25:22,52
I been thinking about you.

349
00:25:25,15 --> 00:25:28,94
- Where's my son? - What?

350
00:25:29,07 --> 00:25:32,45
Do you think that ending up in this place is the worst thing that can happen to you?

351
00:25:35,62 --> 00:25:39,79
- What are you talkin' about? - Where is my son?

352
00:25:39,91 --> 00:25:41,54
Oh.

353
00:25:41,66 --> 00:25:45,38
Somebody nabbed your kid...

354
00:25:45,50 --> 00:25:49,63
and you think that it's me.

355
00:25:49,75 --> 00:25:52,72
How?

356
00:25:52,84 --> 00:25:55,72
I don't got no connections.

357
00:25:55,84 --> 00:25:58,22
I don't got no friends.

358
00:25:58,35 --> 00:26:01,52
I got no job.

359
00:26:01,64 --> 00:26:03,94
I got no money.

360
00:26:04,06 --> 00:26:06,94
And you, motherfucker, are accusing me?

361
00:26:07,06 --> 00:26:09,32
Hey! Hey, get off of him!

362
00:26:09,44 --> 00:26:12,40
I got six of my own kids, and I would die for every one of them.

363
00:26:12,53 --> 00:26:16,95
- Get him outta here! - And I haven't seen them since I got locked up in here because of you!

364
00:26:17,07 --> 00:26:19,33
- Get him outta here. Come on! - Why aren't you in here? Huh?

365
00:26:19,45 --> 00:26:21,83
You fuckin' belong in jail! Who did you bribe?

366
00:26:21,95 --> 00:26:25,50
- I ain't done with you, you fuck! I'll kill you! - Get him out! Get him outta there!

367
00:26:25,62 --> 00:26:29,25
- Who'd you pay to set me up, you fuck? - Get him outta here!

368
00:26:51,40 --> 00:26:53,53
Come on. You tell me that again. Say it again. Come on.

369
00:26:53,65 --> 00:26:57,16
- I said that I wasn't runnin' out this door-- - You weren't runnin'?

370
00:26:57,28 --> 00:26:59,99
Damn, man. I said I wasn't runnin' with him.

371
00:27:00,12 --> 00:27:02,99
I was runnin' away from him 'cause he was, like, chasin' me.

372
00:27:03,12 --> 00:27:05,66
Yeah, look me in the eye and tell me that now.

373
00:27:05,79 --> 00:27:08,50
- I was, I was runnin', but I was runnin-- - Yeah, where were you goin'? - Got the gat, Jimmy.

374
00:27:08,63 --> 00:27:11,42
Huh? Whoa, whoa. Hey. Look at that.

375
00:27:11,54 --> 00:27:13,42
- You ever seen that before? - Uh-uh.

376
00:27:13,55 --> 00:27:16,09
- No? I'm not gonna find your prints on there? - No.

377
00:27:16,22 --> 00:27:19,09
No? Bag that up.

378
00:27:22,22 --> 00:27:26,14
Jimmy, uh, we got a problem here. This guy doesn't want to close his store right now.

379
00:27:26,27 --> 00:27:28,35
Fuck it. Forget about it. Now, tell me about your buddy.

380
00:27:28,48 --> 00:27:30,77
Oh, man. Uh, I don't know. I never saw him before.

381
00:27:30,90 --> 00:27:33,27
- It was the first time I saw him. - Here. Feel that.

382
00:27:33,40 --> 00:27:36,24
- Christ, this thing's pumpin' Kool-Aid. - Yeah, you got a heart problem, there?

383
00:27:36,36 --> 00:27:39,57
- I was runnin'. I wasn't-- - Hey! Hey! Hey!

384
00:27:39,70 --> 00:27:43,20
Wait. I smell a little bullshit here. I think he's runnin' a game on me.

385
00:27:43,33 --> 00:27:46,16
- I think he's an LAD. - You a lyin'-ass dog?

386
00:27:46,29 --> 00:27:49,87
- You got any, uh, Frankenberry cereal with the marshmallows? - The guy was chasin' me and l--

387
00:27:50,00 --> 00:27:53,84
- Yo, you get me a lawyer, all right? - You get your own fuckin' lawyer.

388
00:27:57,30 --> 00:27:59,18
Yo, man, these cuffs are too tight, man.

389
00:27:59,30 --> 00:28:02,14
That's cause they're new. They'll stretch. You gotta give them a little time.

390
00:28:02,26 --> 00:28:06,02
- Get in the car. You want a pizza? You want a hot dog? What do you want? - Here you go, Jimmy.

391
00:28:06,14 --> 00:28:09,39
- Thanks. - Let's go back to the house.

392
00:29:22,55 --> 00:29:25,80
Are you a known scumbag in this precinct or not? Shake your head.

393
00:29:27,85 --> 00:29:30,06
Go on.

394
00:29:31,39 --> 00:29:33,85
Now, a high-profile kid got snatched yesterday.

395
00:29:33,98 --> 00:29:39,23
You have no idea who knows about it, huh? NYPD, FBl. Do you?

396
00:29:39,36 --> 00:29:42,65
Shake your head.

397
00:29:42,78 --> 00:29:45,32
No. So what do you do?

398
00:29:45,45 --> 00:29:50,79
You, a known scumbag, walks into a grocery store filled with cops...

399
00:29:50,91 --> 00:29:52,79
and you ask for a box of kiddie cereal.

400
00:29:52,91 --> 00:29:56,75
I don't know about you, but I think that makes you a four-star asshole.

401
00:29:56,88 --> 00:29:59,21
What do you think?

402
00:30:08,64 --> 00:30:12,18
What the hell were you gonna do with the videos? Huh?

403
00:30:12,31 --> 00:30:15,40
The kid's got tape on his eyes, for Christ's sake.

404
00:30:15,52 --> 00:30:17,44
I thought he could listen to 'em.

405
00:30:22,32 --> 00:30:24,32
Don't be stupid again.

406
00:30:33,16 --> 00:30:36,04
- Jimmy. - Hey.

407
00:30:36,17 --> 00:30:38,54
I was just dreamin' about you.

408
00:30:38,67 --> 00:30:41,71
- Was it good? - Mm-mmm.

409
00:30:41,84 --> 00:30:47,47
No. My father was back, and then he was beating me up again.

410
00:30:47,59 --> 00:30:52,39
And then you were there, but you-- you didn't do anything.

411
00:30:52,52 --> 00:30:54,60
You were just standing there and watching.

412
00:30:54,73 --> 00:30:58,48
Yeah, well, you know that's just a dream.

413
00:30:58,61 --> 00:31:01,90
- I locked his ass up, remember? - Yeah. I know.

414
00:31:06,86 --> 00:31:09,45
Where you been, man? I'm goin' out of my mind here, you know.

415
00:31:09,57 --> 00:31:11,99
Hey, it's all right.

416
00:31:12,12 --> 00:31:15,04
These guys-- These guys are wacko.

417
00:31:15,16 --> 00:31:17,58
They don't listen to me. They don't respect me.

418
00:31:17,71 --> 00:31:20,42
- I don't trust them. - Don't worry about them. They're afraid of me.

419
00:31:20,54 --> 00:31:24,26
- Why do we need them? Why? - We can't do this alone.

420
00:31:24,38 --> 00:31:26,93
And the kid. I'm scared shit of this kid.

421
00:31:27,05 --> 00:31:28,93
I think we should just do this now. Get rid of him.

422
00:31:29,05 --> 00:31:33,85
- Get it over with, 'cause he's like a time bomb. - Hey, hey, hey, listen to me.

423
00:31:33,97 --> 00:31:39,19
You think you're scared of the kid, but you-- you know what you're really scared of?

424
00:31:39,31 --> 00:31:42,77
Your own humanity.

425
00:31:42,90 --> 00:31:46,49
Your own decency.

426
00:31:48,03 --> 00:31:51,74
'Cause you're good, and that's okay. That's all right.

427
00:31:55,08 --> 00:31:58,00
That's what I need from you.

428
00:32:04,25 --> 00:32:07,97
When the time comes, the kid's my problem, not yours. All right?

429
00:32:08,09 --> 00:32:10,30
Well, you still trust me, don't you?

430
00:32:10,43 --> 00:32:15,77
Yeah? 'Cause you know I can do this, right?

431
00:32:15,89 --> 00:32:18,23
- Yeah. - Right? - Yeah.

432
00:32:22,27 --> 00:32:24,77
Good.

433
00:32:24,90 --> 00:32:26,94
'Cause it's time to get paid.

434
00:32:38,12 --> 00:32:40,50
- Is there anything in the reports? - Yeah.

435
00:32:41,71 --> 00:32:44,34
A lot of stuff we already know.

436
00:32:44,46 --> 00:32:47,05
A lot of stuff we don't know.

437
00:32:47,17 --> 00:32:51,09
Stuff you don't want to know.

438
00:32:51,22 --> 00:32:54,68
You know, you tell yourself-- No, you lie to yourself...

439
00:32:54,80 --> 00:33:00,48
that, uh, you're doing all this...

440
00:33:00,60 --> 00:33:02,10
for your family.

441
00:33:02,23 --> 00:33:04,81
Security, money, the future.

442
00:33:04,94 --> 00:33:08,74
All this-this-this king of the mountain bullshit.

443
00:33:08,86 --> 00:33:12,45
It's bullshit.

444
00:33:12,57 --> 00:33:16,99
I keep seeing him tied up like that with those handcuffs, and, uh...

445
00:33:21,29 --> 00:33:23,46
I can't help him.

446
00:33:24,58 --> 00:33:27,30
I can't help him. I can't--

447
00:33:32,01 --> 00:33:34,93
- It's upstairs. - Kate, where's Tom? Come on, now.

448
00:33:35,05 --> 00:33:39,02
Let's do this. Come on. Come on.

449
00:33:39,14 --> 00:33:41,73
- Comin' in. - All right, here they come. Here they come.

450
00:33:41,85 --> 00:33:43,94
Remember the drill. Jack!

451
00:33:47,32 --> 00:33:49,19
Hello?

452
00:33:49,32 --> 00:33:51,69
- Mr Mullen? - Yes.

453
00:33:51,82 --> 00:33:55,11
- Are you good to go? - Am l-- Am l-- Am I what?

454
00:33:56,66 --> 00:34:00,20
Get in the car and drive. 96th Street West. Come alone.

455
00:34:00,33 --> 00:34:02,62
Take the Westside Highway North.

456
00:34:02,75 --> 00:34:06,04
I'm-- I-l-l don't have the money yet. Not yet. But I need more time.

457
00:34:06,17 --> 00:34:08,21
- I'll get it. I-l just-- - Don't fuck with me.

458
00:34:08,34 --> 00:34:10,26
I want, I want to talk to my son.

459
00:34:10,38 --> 00:34:12,63
- Come alone. - Wait. Hold on, uh. S--

460
00:34:12,76 --> 00:34:15,76
Uh, Sean has asthma. Uh, it's very serious.

461
00:34:15,89 --> 00:34:18,85
So, what's the weather like?

462
00:34:18,97 --> 00:34:21,22
Is it rainy? Damp?

463
00:34:23,06 --> 00:34:27,27
Is he in a cellar? On a mountaintop?

464
00:34:27,40 --> 00:34:31,57
Please, don't. My son gets vertigo.

465
00:34:31,69 --> 00:34:35,03
- How's the linguist doing with my accent? - The w-what? The ling--

466
00:34:35,15 --> 00:34:37,45
N-- Hey, there's no one here. Just me.

467
00:34:39,20 --> 00:34:44,41
- Are you sure? - Hey, you think I'm a fuckin' idiot?

468
00:34:44,54 --> 00:34:48,04
- I want to get this over with. - Very good.

469
00:34:48,17 --> 00:34:51,00
- Let's keep it that way. - So how do I get my son back?

470
00:34:51,13 --> 00:34:53,92
- Are you going to pay me? - Of course I am.

471
00:34:55,26 --> 00:34:57,26
Then it shouldn't be a problem.

472
00:35:01,22 --> 00:35:05,44
- He'll call you. - He'll-- When? Who? No, you'll call? He'll call me?

473
00:35:05,56 --> 00:35:07,94
- When? - 96th Street. Come alone.

474
00:35:09,36 --> 00:35:13,36
- Goddam it! - Yes. Sweet and pretty.

475
00:35:13,48 --> 00:35:15,90
They jammed us. Everything's frozen.

476
00:35:16,03 --> 00:35:19,32
Um, did you get it? Where-- Where did you trace it to?

477
00:35:19,45 --> 00:35:21,49
They crashed the computer.

478
00:35:24,87 --> 00:35:26,96
- Did I pick the right guy or what? - Yeah.

479
00:35:27,08 --> 00:35:29,04
- Huh? What'd I tell you? - Yeah. Yeah.

480
00:35:29,17 --> 00:35:32,05
We're gonna get it.

481
00:35:32,17 --> 00:35:35,51
- Let's get Paul wired up. - Whoa, whoa. I'll do it.

482
00:35:37,88 --> 00:35:41,68
I'll do it. Let me.

483
00:35:50,23 --> 00:35:52,94
- He gonna be all right? - He's gonna be great.

484
00:35:53,07 --> 00:35:55,69
- Yeah? - Yeah.

485
00:35:55,82 --> 00:35:58,03
He better be.

486
00:35:58,15 --> 00:36:02,08
I got a situation here. Legally, I can't stop you from doing this.

487
00:36:02,20 --> 00:36:04,20
Understand that this guy-- I don't know where he's coming from...

488
00:36:04,33 --> 00:36:06,29
and I think he's a professional.

489
00:36:06,41 --> 00:36:08,29
Now, if he starts throwing us curve balls out there...

490
00:36:08,41 --> 00:36:12,67
we are gonna have to improvise, and we might not be able to protect you, Mr Mullen.

491
00:36:12,79 --> 00:36:16,63
I think it would be wiser if you just let one of our guys make the drop.

492
00:36:16,76 --> 00:36:19,76
- Ma-Maybe you shouldn't do it. - Look, I'm okay. I'm okay, really.

493
00:36:19,88 --> 00:36:22,89
I-- I just want to give him what he expects.

494
00:36:23,01 --> 00:36:25,81
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

495
00:36:25,93 --> 00:36:29,06
Look. It's almost over, kid.

496
00:36:29,19 --> 00:36:32,56
I'm gonna get you back with your parents. Promise.

497
00:36:32,69 --> 00:36:35,15
- When? - Soon. - When?

498
00:36:37,69 --> 00:36:38,90
When?

499
00:36:39,20 --> 00:36:41,99
-There are tracking devices in the bags. -Monty wants the packages--

500
00:36:42,12 --> 00:36:43,99
- Do you have any other questions? - All right, the car's completely wired.

501
00:36:44,12 --> 00:36:47,08
- Any problems, we'll be right there. - He said I was to come alone.

502
00:36:47,20 --> 00:36:49,00
- All we're doin' is following the money, Tom. - Okay.

503
00:36:49,12 --> 00:36:50,71
- We'll always be a safe distance away. - Okay.

504
00:36:50,83 --> 00:36:52,71
Listen. Let me give you a tip.

505
00:36:52,83 --> 00:36:55,09
This here's a business transaction. All right?

506
00:36:55,21 --> 00:36:56,96
You're a businessman. He's a businessman.

507
00:36:57,09 --> 00:36:59,63
You think of this as business, you'll be fine.

508
00:37:01,30 --> 00:37:03,18
All right?

509
00:37:10,64 --> 00:37:12,52
Get him back.

510
00:37:31,92 --> 00:37:36,92
CP to S.O. units. All units converge on 269 West 125 Street.

511
00:37:37,05 --> 00:37:40,17
500 Unit to CP. We have a visual on the package.

512
00:37:47,56 --> 00:37:49,31
Yeah?

513
00:37:49,43 --> 00:37:51,94
Okay, listen up. I'm only gonna say this once.

514
00:37:52,06 --> 00:37:55,73
Get off at 125th Street, go right three blocks...

515
00:37:55,86 --> 00:37:58,27
to the Kasarda Rec Center.

516
00:37:58,40 --> 00:38:02,32
- Take the suitcases inside with you. - Son of a bitch is scrolling us.

517
00:38:02,45 --> 00:38:06,66
In the swimming pool, there's a locker key down by the drain...

518
00:38:06,78 --> 00:38:08,99
in the deep end.

519
00:38:09,12 --> 00:38:11,25
There'll be somebody watching you.

520
00:38:11,37 --> 00:38:13,29
You won't see them, but they'll see you.

521
00:38:13,41 --> 00:38:15,92
I want you to get that key.

522
00:38:16,04 --> 00:38:19,00
I want you fully clothed when you do.

523
00:38:19,13 --> 00:38:23,59
You so much as remove your wristwatch, your son dies.

524
00:38:23,72 --> 00:38:27,60
When you have the key, go find the locker.

525
00:38:27,72 --> 00:38:30,22
- You got seven minutes. - All right, I'll do everything you say.

526
00:38:30,35 --> 00:38:32,35
I just need you to repeat it so I could be very clear.

527
00:38:32,48 --> 00:38:35,52
- Seven minutes. - To do what? To get there? To jump in the pool?

528
00:38:35,65 --> 00:38:39,73
Goddam it. Ah, Jesus.

529
00:38:42,90 --> 00:38:44,86
- We got it. - He what?

530
00:38:44,99 --> 00:38:47,70
- Blocked out the trace. Should we pull it? - No.

531
00:38:47,82 --> 00:38:50,03
Run the trace again.

532
00:38:50,16 --> 00:38:53,54
All right, let's start dumping hackers and phreakers in the profile. Anybody high tech.

533
00:38:53,66 --> 00:38:57,92
Uh, we'll cross match that with military background, police background...

534
00:38:58,04 --> 00:39:01,09
uh, security training, uh, hostage negotiations.

535
00:39:13,98 --> 00:39:17,10
- Where's the pool? - It's over there.

536
00:39:17,23 --> 00:39:20,23
Hands in front of you. Hands straight out.

537
00:39:20,36 --> 00:39:23,57
Hands to the side. Push. Hands in front.

538
00:39:23,69 --> 00:39:25,57
Hands up.

539
00:39:26,70 --> 00:39:30,07
Hands in front of you.

540
00:39:34,87 --> 00:39:37,71
Shit! We lost him.

541
00:39:37,83 --> 00:39:39,13
Damn it.

542
00:39:42,75 --> 00:39:44,71
Track all unsubs that exit the building.

543
00:40:07,40 --> 00:40:09,95
You're going too slow. Get your ass moving.

544
00:40:10,07 --> 00:40:12,45
Now, put on the hat and the overalls.

545
00:40:12,58 --> 00:40:15,50
Take the canvas bags downstairs to the boiler room.

546
00:40:15,62 --> 00:40:18,83
Use the stairs by the shower.

547
00:40:18,96 --> 00:40:21,79
Put the money into the new bags.

548
00:40:21,92 --> 00:40:24,88
Then leave the building and find a Monte Carlo.

549
00:40:25,00 --> 00:40:27,80
There's a key taped to the phone.

550
00:40:27,92 --> 00:40:30,34
Leave the phone with the suitcases and drive to the Holland Tunnel.

551
00:40:30,47 --> 00:40:33,18
We'll be watching you, Tom.

552
00:41:02,96 --> 00:41:05,55
We're getting a reading on those suitcases. They haven't moved.

553
00:41:05,67 --> 00:41:07,84
Tell the S.O. Ieader I want that building cleared.

554
00:41:12,68 --> 00:41:15,64
500 to S.O. units. We got an eyeball. We got the car.

555
00:41:15,76 --> 00:41:17,52
The car has not moved.

556
00:41:32,32 --> 00:41:36,03
S.O. 15 to CP. Located the packages. They're empty.

557
00:41:36,16 --> 00:41:40,87
Sir, we've got four vehicles ID'd in the perimeter, one with a broken taillight.

558
00:41:41,00 --> 00:41:44,25
Put out a description of those vehicles.

559
00:41:44,38 --> 00:41:46,38
Have all units grid out and locate them.

560
00:41:59,35 --> 00:42:02,06
Pick me up, asshole.

561
00:42:05,73 --> 00:42:07,61
Now what?

562
00:42:07,73 --> 00:42:10,07
So how you holding up? Did you have a nice swim?

563
00:42:10,19 --> 00:42:12,82
Not bad. How're you doing?

564
00:42:12,95 --> 00:42:16,24
Hey, I'm good. I'm good. You know, thanks for asking.

565
00:42:17,83 --> 00:42:21,29
- How's Sean? - Havin' the time of his life.

566
00:42:23,41 --> 00:42:26,63
Hey, I saw your TV commercial. It's not bad. It's pretty good.

567
00:42:26,75 --> 00:42:29,42
But let me ask you something. You got a frequent flyer programme?

568
00:42:29,55 --> 00:42:32,47
'Cause if you do, maybe when this is over...

569
00:42:32,59 --> 00:42:34,93
I might just take an Endeavor flight the hell outta here.

570
00:42:37,30 --> 00:42:39,22
Why? Why me?

571
00:42:39,35 --> 00:42:41,22
Why you?

572
00:42:43,35 --> 00:42:46,98
'Cause you buy your way out of trouble.

573
00:42:47,11 --> 00:42:50,90
Don't you? I read about you and that union guy.

574
00:42:51,03 --> 00:42:55,82
You should've gone to jail for that, but I guess you're a pretty goddam good liar, huh?

575
00:42:56,95 --> 00:42:59,08
I saw you on TV, Tom...

576
00:42:59,20 --> 00:43:02,33
telling everybody how innocent you were.

577
00:43:02,45 --> 00:43:05,46
I looked at your eyes.

578
00:43:05,58 --> 00:43:10,71
You know what? You're a lyin'-ass dog, pal.

579
00:43:10,84 --> 00:43:14,30
I know you paid that guy off.

580
00:43:14,42 --> 00:43:16,47
You're a payer.

581
00:43:16,59 --> 00:43:19,30
You did it once.

582
00:43:19,43 --> 00:43:21,97
Now you're gonna do it again.

583
00:43:36,99 --> 00:43:41,16
- You okay? - Yeah.

584
00:43:41,28 --> 00:43:43,45
- Listen, Cub. You want me to do this? - Jimmy said me.

585
00:43:43,58 --> 00:43:46,66
- Fuck what Jimmy said. - Look, I know the job, man.

586
00:43:54,21 --> 00:43:56,76
Clark, man.

587
00:43:56,88 --> 00:44:00,72
I ain't giving Jimmy the money until he cuts the kid loose.

588
00:44:03,60 --> 00:44:05,89
I-- I just ain't gonna do it, man.

589
00:44:06,02 --> 00:44:08,73
What are you-- Cub.

590
00:44:23,16 --> 00:44:25,04
You a movie fan, Tom?

591
00:44:27,83 --> 00:44:31,71
- Ever see that movie The Time Machine? - No.

592
00:44:31,84 --> 00:44:34,71
It's the, uh, land of the future, right?

593
00:44:34,84 --> 00:44:38,55
There's only two kinds of people in the world now:

594
00:44:38,68 --> 00:44:41,89
the Morlocks and the Eloi.

595
00:44:44,18 --> 00:44:47,60
- Okay. - And the Elois, they live above ground.

596
00:44:47,73 --> 00:44:50,40
They wear togas. They're all blond.

597
00:44:50,52 --> 00:44:52,52
They eat grapes and shit like that.

598
00:44:52,65 --> 00:44:54,52
But it's like the Garden of Eden there.

599
00:44:54,65 --> 00:45:00,15
I mean, basically, everybody just lays around, listens to harp music.

600
00:45:00,28 --> 00:45:03,24
- How do I get my boy back? - Now, the Morlocks...

601
00:45:04,70 --> 00:45:06,83
they live underground, right?

602
00:45:06,95 --> 00:45:11,75
Big, hairy, ugly suckers like you wouldn't wish on an ape, right?

603
00:45:11,88 --> 00:45:14,96
They're down there with all this machinery. They're doing all the labour.

604
00:45:15,09 --> 00:45:20,22
They're making sure that the Elois have enough food and-- and togas.

605
00:45:20,34 --> 00:45:24,60
- Are you gonna answer me? - Well, this is a great deal if you're an Eloi, right?

606
00:45:24,72 --> 00:45:27,52
There's only one thing.

607
00:45:27,64 --> 00:45:30,52
Every once in a while, a Morlock comes up to the surface...

608
00:45:30,64 --> 00:45:35,32
and snatches an Eloi, takes him down there.

609
00:45:35,44 --> 00:45:39,03
All right, I'm done driving 'til you tell me what I want to know.

610
00:45:39,15 --> 00:45:42,07
The Morlocks, they don't eat grapes.

611
00:45:42,20 --> 00:45:45,62
They're cannibals. They eat Elois.

612
00:45:46,99 --> 00:45:50,58
So when I think about, uh, The Time Machine...

613
00:45:50,71 --> 00:45:53,50
it kind of reminds me of New York City, you know?

614
00:45:55,63 --> 00:45:58,63
See, you're an Eloi.

615
00:45:58,76 --> 00:46:01,30
You and all your friends, walking around like zombies...

616
00:46:01,42 --> 00:46:04,47
with no fuckin' idea of the shit goin' on down below.

617
00:46:05,60 --> 00:46:08,18
So does this make me a Morlock?

618
00:46:10,43 --> 00:46:14,15
I don't like to think of myself like--

619
00:46:14,27 --> 00:46:16,61
I guess it does.

620
00:46:16,73 --> 00:46:21,03
And every once in a while, one of you gets snatched.

621
00:46:23,28 --> 00:46:25,70
I guess that's--

622
00:46:41,42 --> 00:46:43,51
See ya.

623
00:46:43,63 --> 00:46:47,68
What a city. See you at the Whitney.

624
00:46:49,35 --> 00:46:52,02
See you at the Four Seasons.

625
00:46:53,18 --> 00:46:56,35
See you at the Met. See ya.

626
00:46:57,48 --> 00:46:59,65
See you.

627
00:46:59,77 --> 00:47:01,65
See you.

628
00:47:04,74 --> 00:47:08,45
- You on the move again, Tom? - Yeah.

629
00:47:08,58 --> 00:47:12,66
Okay, here we go. About a mile up ahead, the road splits.

630
00:47:12,79 --> 00:47:16,92
Take the exit onto Saddle River Road, go to the stone quarry.

631
00:47:17,04 --> 00:47:19,38
Drive ten miles an hour.

632
00:47:19,50 --> 00:47:22,42
I'm jumpin' through all your goddam hoops. How am I gonna get my boy back?

633
00:47:22,55 --> 00:47:26,22
We'll swap. You give me the bags, I'll give you an address.

634
00:47:28,72 --> 00:47:31,39
Good luck to you, laddie.

635
00:48:39,25 --> 00:48:42,00
Get back in the fucking car!

636
00:48:42,13 --> 00:48:44,46
Now, throw out the keys.

637
00:48:46,05 --> 00:48:48,26
Give me the money, man.

638
00:48:48,38 --> 00:48:50,51
- Give me the address. - Give me the fuckin' money, man!

639
00:48:50,64 --> 00:48:54,97
- You said you were gonna give me the address. - What?

640
00:48:55,10 --> 00:48:59,44
Do you want to see your kid again, man? Then give me the money!

641
00:48:59,56 --> 00:49:02,81
Goddam it! Give me that address, goddam you!

642
00:49:07,28 --> 00:49:10,07
- Don't be fuckin' stupid, man! - This is the FBl.

643
00:49:10,20 --> 00:49:13,03
Drop the gun and step away from the vehicle.

644
00:49:13,16 --> 00:49:17,00
- Put your hands in the air. Step away from the vehicle. - Son of a bitch!

645
00:49:17,12 --> 00:49:21,42
- Mullen, stay back. Get down. - CP, need some help here.

646
00:49:21,54 --> 00:49:23,54
He's surrounded. We've gone overt.

647
00:49:23,67 --> 00:49:27,21
We have one subject on the ground operating an ATV.

648
00:49:27,34 --> 00:49:30,22
A white male armed with a handgun, and he's got--

649
00:49:30,34 --> 00:49:33,51
- We have an eye on him. - Good. - Who is that?

650
00:49:35,39 --> 00:49:37,68
Come on, Cubby. Come on, Cubby.

651
00:49:44,86 --> 00:49:47,90
- Stop, or we'll shoot. - Get off the vehicle and lie down.

652
00:49:48,03 --> 00:49:49,90
You have no way out.

653
00:49:53,07 --> 00:49:55,58
You are surrounded. Give yourself up.

654
00:49:55,70 --> 00:49:58,04
- This is the FBl. - You've got nowhere to go.

655
00:49:58,16 --> 00:50:00,46
We have agents on the ground.

656
00:50:10,63 --> 00:50:13,09
This is your last warning.

657
00:50:18,81 --> 00:50:21,73
Surrender yourself now!

658
00:50:21,85 --> 00:50:24,48
This is the FBl.

659
00:50:24,60 --> 00:50:27,23
There is nowhere to go.

660
00:50:27,36 --> 00:50:30,69
Drop the gun. Stop at once.

661
00:50:37,87 --> 00:50:40,25
Move! Move!

662
00:50:40,37 --> 00:50:43,75
SWAT Team Leader to CP. We have deployed. We're movin' in.

663
00:50:52,55 --> 00:50:54,43
Got a green light! Take him out!

664
00:50:58,56 --> 00:51:01,81
Oh, shit.

665
00:51:01,93 --> 00:51:05,98
SWAT Team Leader to CP. We have an agent down. We have a subject down.

666
00:51:08,11 --> 00:51:10,28
Who got shot? Who the hell was shot?

667
00:51:27,58 --> 00:51:30,30
Where is he? What have you done with him?

668
00:51:31,75 --> 00:51:34,47
What?

669
00:51:34,59 --> 00:51:37,51
Say it. Come on.

670
00:51:37,64 --> 00:51:40,10
- Stand back. Come on. Step back. - No, no, he--

671
00:51:40,22 --> 00:51:42,52
- He's trying to tell me something. - Look, back off. Let us stabilize him.

672
00:51:42,64 --> 00:51:45,48
- Medic! - He's trying to tell me where my son is. I'm sure of it.

673
00:51:47,94 --> 00:51:50,19
What are you people do-- I did not authorize this!

674
00:51:50,32 --> 00:51:53,99
- We're here under orders. - That fucking liar!

675
00:51:54,11 --> 00:51:56,11
- Oh, we're losin' him. - Don't let him die.

676
00:51:56,24 --> 00:51:58,53
Jesus Christ, don't let him die. God, don't let him die.

677
00:52:02,29 --> 00:52:06,21
- Come on, man. Don't give up. Don't give up. - Get the choppers.

678
00:52:06,33 --> 00:52:08,83
Stay with him. Come on.

679
00:52:10,63 --> 00:52:13,42
- Shit! - What?

680
00:52:13,55 --> 00:52:16,01
Ten-seven, sir.

681
00:52:18,38 --> 00:52:20,26
He's dead.

682
00:52:32,52 --> 00:52:34,78
How-- How am I gonna find Sean now?

683
00:52:50,75 --> 00:52:52,42
You killed my son.

684
00:52:52,54 --> 00:52:55,05
SWAT Team Leader to CP. We're movin' out.

685
00:52:55,17 --> 00:52:57,84
S.O. Leader, you've got it.

686
00:53:20,53 --> 00:53:24,87
Give me as much as you can. This guy's got to be on parole, probation, something.

687
00:53:24,99 --> 00:53:28,00
- Get the name of-- - I told you no cops. - Ah, jeez!

688
00:53:31,12 --> 00:53:34,13
- You were supposed to follow the money! - They were following the money, Tom.

689
00:53:34,25 --> 00:53:36,63
The guy had a gun in your face. They didn't have a choice.

690
00:53:36,75 --> 00:53:38,51
They thought you were in direct danger.

691
00:53:38,63 --> 00:53:41,30
What does that mean? What does-- What does "wrong" mean? I mean, is he dead?

692
00:53:41,43 --> 00:53:44,97
Because if he's dead, just say he's dead. Don't tell me something went wrong.

693
00:53:45,10 --> 00:53:49,10
- Just say my son is dead! - Kate, we are operating under the assumption that he's alive.

694
00:53:49,23 --> 00:53:52,90
You mean you don't know! You don't know where he is! You don't know if he is!

695
00:53:53,02 --> 00:53:55,69
You're the goddam FBl, and you don't know shit!

696
00:53:55,82 --> 00:53:58,40
- We have every agent-- every agent-- - You killed the son of a bitch and now-- What?

697
00:53:58,53 --> 00:54:00,95
- Katie. Katie. - Get-- God!

698
00:54:02,28 --> 00:54:05,28
Go. Go away. Go. Go.

699
00:54:07,45 --> 00:54:10,29
We know that the kidnapper at the quarry was not alone.

700
00:54:10,41 --> 00:54:13,17
We know that.

701
00:54:13,29 --> 00:54:17,71
We also have a real good idea about who he was teamed up with. Now, let me show you something.

702
00:54:17,84 --> 00:54:21,09
The guy at the quarry, Cubby Barnes, has been in jail twice for burglary.

703
00:54:21,22 --> 00:54:23,34
This is no high-tech mastermind.

704
00:54:23,47 --> 00:54:28,26
This guy right here-- Kate, Tom, you recognize him?

705
00:54:33,69 --> 00:54:35,31
- Do you? - No. - Okay.

706
00:54:35,44 --> 00:54:38,78
Now, this is Clark Barnes, brother to the subject.

707
00:54:38,90 --> 00:54:43,11
Now, we went back and we found him in your son's video of the park.

708
00:54:43,24 --> 00:54:45,57
This guy is the brains in the family...

709
00:54:45,70 --> 00:54:49,04
and we also know he's a lot higher up the criminal food chain.

710
00:54:49,16 --> 00:54:52,71
According to the NYPD, this guy Clark, his brother Cubby, they're supposed to be inseparable.

711
00:54:52,83 --> 00:54:55,25
Now, I guarantee you, we are gonna do our homework on this...

712
00:54:55,38 --> 00:54:57,29
and we will come up with another player.

713
00:54:57,42 --> 00:54:59,59
In the meantime, what we gotta do--

714
00:54:59,71 --> 00:55:02,01
Aw, Christ. Not this shit.

715
00:55:02,13 --> 00:55:04,55
- We got a cameraman. - Jack.

716
00:55:04,68 --> 00:55:07,10
Can we get some agents out there?

717
00:55:10,18 --> 00:55:13,52
- This just in. A breaking story from our New York bureau. - Lonnie. It's out.

718
00:55:13,64 --> 00:55:19,27
State police sources tell us a man has been shot and killed in an apparent botched ransom drop.

719
00:55:19,40 --> 00:55:23,86
There's also word that multimillionaire airline mogul Tom Mullen has been placed at the scene.

720
00:55:23,99 --> 00:55:26,57
With more on that story, let's go to Donna Hanover live...

721
00:55:26,70 --> 00:55:29,33
-in front of Tom Mullen's New York home. -Goddam. -Donna.

722
00:55:29,45 --> 00:55:32,33
We have no official report yet on the identity of the victim...

723
00:55:32,45 --> 00:55:35,00
or his role in the Sean Mullen kidnapping.

724
00:55:35,12 --> 00:55:38,08
Hopefully, we'll have more information for you later in this hour...

725
00:55:38,21 --> 00:55:42,09
but details have been slow to come from the police and FBI sources.

726
00:55:42,21 --> 00:55:44,13
We'll bring you full developments tomorrow morning...

727
00:55:44,26 --> 00:55:46,43
beginning with Good Day, New York, and, of course...

728
00:55:46,55 --> 00:55:49,14
- as things happen here at the Mullen apartment building, - Hey, wh-what are you doing?

729
00:55:49,26 --> 00:55:51,76
- we'll bring you the information. - Calling my mother. - No, man, you can't do that.

730
00:55:51,89 --> 00:55:55,44
- Not from this phone. - Get the fuck outta here. - Hey, hey, put the phone down.

731
00:55:55,56 --> 00:55:59,73
What's the matter, Jimmy? You don't want my mother to know that her son's dead 'cause you fucked up?

732
00:55:59,86 --> 00:56:03,40
-Turn that shit off. -I mean, that's what happened, isn't it?

733
00:56:03,53 --> 00:56:06,28
I mean, it's not exactly like this guy just rolled over, is it, Jim?

734
00:56:06,40 --> 00:56:09,41
Just take it easy. Put the goddam phone down.

735
00:56:14,25 --> 00:56:17,33
He's a fuckin' kid.

736
00:56:17,46 --> 00:56:19,33
Oh, shit!

737
00:56:20,92 --> 00:56:23,46
Hey, hey, calm down. Take it easy.

738
00:56:23,59 --> 00:56:27,26
You want me to calm down, huh? You want me to fucking calm down?

739
00:56:27,38 --> 00:56:30,47
You realize they're looking for me right now, Jimmy? I'm fingered!

740
00:56:30,60 --> 00:56:33,64
- I can't go back to my life! What do you want me to do? You tell me! - Shut up.

741
00:56:33,77 --> 00:56:37,14
- You tell me, huh? - You know, you're not gonna be able to go to your brother's funeral either, man.

742
00:56:37,27 --> 00:56:40,31
Shut the fuck up! The kid goes in the ground, Jim.

743
00:56:40,44 --> 00:56:42,61
That's it. That's it. Fuck the money.

744
00:56:42,73 --> 00:56:45,03
- We do the kid, and I'm outta here. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

745
00:56:45,15 --> 00:56:47,86
He's right. I mean, you said you were gonna do it anyhow.

746
00:56:47,99 --> 00:56:50,49
Shut up!

747
00:56:50,62 --> 00:56:53,20
- Where are you goin'? - Get out of my fuckin'--

748
00:57:03,96 --> 00:57:05,96
Take a breath.

749
00:57:06,09 --> 00:57:08,72
Come on, come on. Take a breath.

750
00:57:11,47 --> 00:57:14,18
I brought you in on this 'cause you had brains and balls.

751
00:57:16,14 --> 00:57:18,89
Think.

752
00:57:19,02 --> 00:57:22,15
Hmm? The kid's gonna die...

753
00:57:22,27 --> 00:57:24,61
when we don't need him any more.

754
00:57:24,73 --> 00:57:28,40
Now, use your fuckin' head.

755
00:57:32,24 --> 00:57:34,70
Go check on the kid.

756
00:57:39,87 --> 00:57:42,04
It's all right. Go on.

757
00:57:42,17 --> 00:57:44,04
Go on.

758
00:57:51,84 --> 00:57:55,35
They kill your brother, and you wanna walk away?

759
00:57:55,47 --> 00:57:57,60
What the hell does that make you?

760
00:58:00,85 --> 00:58:03,15
This thing is not over.

761
00:58:03,27 --> 00:58:05,73
I swear to you right now...

762
00:58:05,86 --> 00:58:09,57
now, more than ever...

763
00:58:09,69 --> 00:58:13,16
this guy will pay.

764
00:58:25,54 --> 00:58:28,09
Can I have a chocolate bar?

765
00:58:35,30 --> 00:58:38,10
- I know you. - No, you don't.

766
00:58:38,22 --> 00:58:41,18
Don't look at me! Don't look at me.

767
00:58:41,31 --> 00:58:44,44
Chocolate bar. What, do you think this isn't happening?

768
00:58:44,56 --> 00:58:47,44
What, you think your dad's gonna come in and save you? ls that what you think?

769
00:58:47,57 --> 00:58:50,11
Well, he ain't. Nobody's comin', all right?

770
00:58:50,24 --> 00:58:53,70
You understand that? Nobody's comin', 'cause this is it for you.

771
00:58:56,91 --> 00:59:01,08
...surfacing surrounding the high-profile kidnapping case of Tom Mullen's son, Sean.

772
00:59:01,20 --> 00:59:04,79
- New York One has exclusive information about-- - You know what the brothers call this?

773
00:59:04,92 --> 00:59:07,42
This is "more drama," right?

774
00:59:07,54 --> 00:59:13,05
Like, "Shit, man, more drama? Best stay indoors today."

775
00:59:13,17 --> 00:59:16,43
You ever hear that? "More drama."

776
00:59:16,55 --> 00:59:20,06
More drama. More Dramamine.

777
00:59:21,31 --> 00:59:24,19
Drambuie.

778
00:59:24,31 --> 00:59:27,98
- You all right? - No, yeah. Yeah, good.

779
00:59:28,11 --> 00:59:29,98
Yeah.

780
00:59:35,45 --> 00:59:38,99
- Kimba, listen to this. - It shouldn't be a problem. - That.

781
00:59:39,12 --> 00:59:42,25
After "lt shouldn't be a problem," what do you hear?

782
00:59:42,37 --> 00:59:44,66
Wait. Play it back again.

783
00:59:46,67 --> 00:59:50,34
- It shouldn't be a problem. - It sounds like some kind of horn.

784
00:59:50,46 --> 00:59:53,67
Yeah, I know it's a horn, but what-- It's like--

785
00:59:53,80 --> 00:59:58,55
- It's like there's a horn, a sort of foghorn. - It's too fast for a ferry.

786
01:00:00,31 --> 01:00:02,52
It shouldn't be a problem.

787
01:00:04,98 --> 01:00:08,65
In the meantime, now you give her a big hug from me.

788
01:00:08,77 --> 01:00:11,52
Nah, I don't care. You wake her up.

789
01:00:11,65 --> 01:00:14,11
Nah, don't wake her up. I'm just--

790
01:00:14,24 --> 01:00:18,20
Ah, girl, I am so glad we are not rich.

791
01:00:18,32 --> 01:00:22,74
You just gotta thank God for what you have.

792
01:00:22,87 --> 01:00:25,75
I love you too. I gotta go. I'm gonna call you back.

793
01:00:25,87 --> 01:00:29,58
Okay. Bye-bye. Hey.

794
01:00:34,88 --> 01:00:36,76
Why--

795
01:00:41,35 --> 01:00:43,85
Why would this guy, these people-- Why would they--

796
01:00:47,39 --> 01:00:52,48
Why would they ever let my son go no matter what I do?

797
01:00:52,61 --> 01:00:57,49
I mean, no matter what I do. I mean, pay, don't pay, comply, tell him to go fuck himself.

798
01:00:57,61 --> 01:00:59,57
Why would they give him back?

799
01:00:59,70 --> 01:01:01,95
I mean, he's a witness any way you cut it.

800
01:01:02,08 --> 01:01:06,70
It's all bullshit. It's all just-- just seven out of ten.

801
01:01:06,83 --> 01:01:09,08
What are you saying?

802
01:01:12,96 --> 01:01:14,84
All right.

803
01:01:14,96 --> 01:01:18,76
Morlock Man gets his money, I don't think we'll ever see Sean again.

804
01:01:18,88 --> 01:01:20,93
That's if he's still alive to begin with.

805
01:01:21,05 --> 01:01:22,76
- Well, now... - Tom?

806
01:01:22,89 --> 01:01:24,76
are you talkin' about not paying?

807
01:01:24,89 --> 01:01:28,14
- No. No, we pay him. - Now, wait a minute. Listen to me.

808
01:01:28,27 --> 01:01:31,94
Morlock Man says the pick-up guy will give me an address for Sean.

809
01:01:32,06 --> 01:01:34,61
I get there, the guy sticks a gun in my face.

810
01:01:34,73 --> 01:01:36,61
I said, "You want the money? Now give me the address. Where's the address?"

811
01:01:36,73 --> 01:01:38,90
You should have seen his face.

812
01:01:39,03 --> 01:01:42,78
He had no, absolutely no idea what I was talking about. None.

813
01:01:42,91 --> 01:01:46,79
- Okay. - This is not business to him. This is very personal.

814
01:01:46,91 --> 01:01:50,21
I tell you that everybody pays, and we get back seven out of ten.

815
01:01:50,33 --> 01:01:54,67
- If we give him what he wants, he will kill Sean. - Tom, you gotta play the odds, man.

816
01:01:54,79 --> 01:01:57,46
I've been doing this for 18 years.

817
01:01:57,59 --> 01:02:01,84
And if I were a betting man, I would bet on the people who pay every time out of the gate.

818
01:02:04,10 --> 01:02:06,85
Did you bet on the ones where you got back a corpse?

819
01:02:15,02 --> 01:02:16,52
Kate.

820
01:02:19,49 --> 01:02:23,74
If you want to see your child again...

821
01:02:23,87 --> 01:02:27,37
you gotta help me with him.

822
01:02:28,45 --> 01:02:30,08
- Stations! - Mark it.

823
01:02:34,46 --> 01:02:38,38
-Mullen. -You think you can run a game on me and fuck me out of my money?

824
01:02:38,51 --> 01:02:40,97
No, l--

825
01:02:41,09 --> 01:02:44,47
It was out of my control. I did exactly what you said.

826
01:02:44,59 --> 01:02:46,85
You did?

827
01:02:46,97 --> 01:02:50,23
This is how you want to play it, huh? You're gonna bullshit me, Tom?

828
01:02:50,35 --> 01:02:52,39
Who do you think you're dealin' with?

829
01:02:52,52 --> 01:02:55,48
They told you they were just gonna follow the cash, right? Huh?

830
01:02:55,61 --> 01:02:57,86
Who's the asshole you're listening to over there?

831
01:02:57,98 --> 01:03:01,32
Is he a fed? I said no cops.

832
01:03:01,44 --> 01:03:05,37
No FBl. You pay me. It shouldn't be a problem. Now we got a fuckin' circus out there.

833
01:03:05,49 --> 01:03:07,78
All right. Just say what you want to say.

834
01:03:07,91 --> 01:03:10,37
- The money. - I want to talk to my son.

835
01:03:10,50 --> 01:03:13,46
Take the FDR Drive down to the Williamsburg Bridge exit.

836
01:03:15,04 --> 01:03:17,38
- No. I know he's dead. - You don't know shit.

837
01:03:17,50 --> 01:03:21,26
- Take FDR Drive down to the Williamsburg Bridge-- - My son is dead. Go to hell!

838
01:03:21,38 --> 01:03:24,22
What did you do? Tom, what did you do?

839
01:03:24,34 --> 01:03:28,39
Oh, God. Please, God. Please, God. Please, God. Please. Please, God.

840
01:03:37,98 --> 01:03:39,82
Mullen.

841
01:03:39,94 --> 01:03:42,07
- Dad? - Sean?

842
01:03:43,44 --> 01:03:45,32
Williamsburg Bridge.

843
01:03:45,45 --> 01:03:48,70
And you assholes listening in, if I smell you clowns within ten miles...

844
01:03:48,83 --> 01:03:51,54
of that money, I'll gut this kid like a fish.

845
01:03:51,54 --> 01:03:51,58
of that money, I'll gut this kid like a fish.

846
01:04:09,47 --> 01:04:11,43
Is there anything else we can use?

847
01:04:13,56 --> 01:04:15,23
Uh, give me Mr Wallace.

848
01:04:17,90 --> 01:04:20,11
I'm going alone.

849
01:04:20,23 --> 01:04:22,19
Is that understood?

850
01:04:22,32 --> 01:04:25,74
No helicopters, no wires. Just me.

851
01:04:34,37 --> 01:04:37,04
- You got the phone? - Yeah, I got the phone.

852
01:04:38,46 --> 01:04:41,17
You gonna be all right?

853
01:04:41,29 --> 01:04:44,13
- Yeah, I'm gonna be all right. - Okay.

854
01:04:59,23 --> 01:05:02,48
Hey, hey, here he comes. Come on. Let's go. Let's go, let's go.

855
01:05:06,44 --> 01:05:08,99
Mr Mullen! Mr Mullen!

856
01:05:09,11 --> 01:05:12,49
- Mullen! - Mr Mullen! - Mr Mullen!

857
01:05:12,62 --> 01:05:14,45
Mr Mullen-- It's not Mullen.

858
01:05:19,00 --> 01:05:20,88
Let's go. That's him.

859
01:05:48,03 --> 01:05:50,70
- Hey, John, keep shooting. - Man, this is fucking great.

860
01:05:54,83 --> 01:05:56,70
Hey!

861
01:05:57,83 --> 01:05:59,79
Come on!

862
01:06:41,37 --> 01:06:44,08
Endeavor Airline CEO Tom Mullen and his family...

863
01:06:44,21 --> 01:06:46,92
are no strangers to the public eye.

864
01:06:47,05 --> 01:06:49,26
As head of the country's fourth largest airline...

865
01:06:49,38 --> 01:06:53,01
Tom Mullen, whose personal stake in the company was reported earlier this year--

866
01:06:56,80 --> 01:06:59,93
But nothing in his triumphant, high-profile life...

867
01:07:00,06 --> 01:07:03,31
could prepare Mullen for the drama presently unfolding around him--

868
01:07:03,44 --> 01:07:07,65
the taking of his nine-year-old son by unidentified kidnappers.

869
01:07:11,40 --> 01:07:15,45
- Where are you at now? - I don't know.

870
01:07:16,87 --> 01:07:19,08
Head up to Houston and Broadway.

871
01:07:22,00 --> 01:07:26,04
- But for now, the city and the country anxiously await word-- - You hear me?

872
01:07:28,59 --> 01:07:30,92
Mullen?

873
01:07:33,34 --> 01:07:37,10
- Change of plan. - What?

874
01:07:37,22 --> 01:07:40,31
Turn on your TV. Channel 5. Keep watching.

875
01:07:40,43 --> 01:07:43,39
It shouldn't be more than an hour or two.

876
01:07:47,19 --> 01:07:49,65
You understand what I'm telling you?

877
01:07:49,77 --> 01:07:51,65
Mullen, what the fuck--

878
01:08:10,38 --> 01:08:12,84
It's mine. Hello?

879
01:08:12,96 --> 01:08:17,47
David, I need you to contact Don Campbell at WNYW.

880
01:08:21,18 --> 01:08:23,85
- All right. - Good.

881
01:08:26,48 --> 01:08:28,86
- Bob, can I talk to you, please? - Sure.

882
01:08:31,90 --> 01:08:34,24
David.

883
01:08:34,53 --> 01:08:38,03
- All right, here we go. - Okay, they're ready.

884
01:08:48,67 --> 01:08:51,96
Pull out of it. All right, everyone. Look alive.

885
01:08:54,17 --> 01:08:59,14
Mr Mullen, we're gonna get you set up right over here. We'll get you wired up with a mike.

886
01:08:59,26 --> 01:09:02,89
I will signal to you from next to the camera.

887
01:09:03,01 --> 01:09:05,89
Ready to go? On five, four...

888
01:09:06,02 --> 01:09:08,85
three, two--

889
01:09:08,98 --> 01:09:13,23
Good afternoon. We are interrupting this programme to bring you an exclusive report.

890
01:09:13,36 --> 01:09:17,65
As you know, we've been following the Mullen kidnapping for about a day or so.

891
01:09:17,78 --> 01:09:20,91
We will get back to our regular programme, but right now we're going to show you something...

892
01:09:21,03 --> 01:09:23,20
that you will only see right here--

893
01:09:23,33 --> 01:09:25,79
Tom Mullen, Sean Mullen's father.

894
01:09:25,91 --> 01:09:28,75
Mr Mullen?

895
01:09:33,04 --> 01:09:34,92
Tom, you're on.

896
01:09:37,51 --> 01:09:39,34
The whole world now knows...

897
01:09:39,47 --> 01:09:41,89
my son, Sean Mullen, was kidnapped...

898
01:09:42,01 --> 01:09:44,22
for ransom three days ago.

899
01:09:44,35 --> 01:09:47,02
This is a recent photograph of him.

900
01:09:47,14 --> 01:09:50,27
Sean, if you're watching, we love you.

901
01:09:51,65 --> 01:09:53,27
And this--

902
01:09:53,40 --> 01:09:56,19
Well, this is what waits for the man that took him.

903
01:09:56,32 --> 01:09:58,24
This is your ransom.

904
01:09:58,36 --> 01:10:00,28
Wait. Shh, shh. I want to see this.

905
01:10:00,41 --> 01:10:02,95
Two million dollars in unmarked bills, just like you wanted.

906
01:10:03,07 --> 01:10:07,37
- Oh-ho! - But this is as close as you'll ever get to it.

907
01:10:07,50 --> 01:10:10,71
You'll never see one dollar of this money...

908
01:10:10,83 --> 01:10:14,63
because no ransom will ever be paid for my son.

909
01:10:14,75 --> 01:10:17,59
Not one dime. Not one penny.

910
01:10:17,71 --> 01:10:22,05
Instead, I'm offering this money as a reward on your head.

911
01:10:23,51 --> 01:10:26,60
Dead or alive. It doesn't matter.

912
01:10:26,72 --> 01:10:30,10
So congratulations. You've just become a $2 million lottery ticket.

913
01:10:30,23 --> 01:10:33,65
Except the odds are much, much better.

914
01:10:33,77 --> 01:10:36,90
Do you know anyone that wouldn't turn you in for $2 million?

915
01:10:37,03 --> 01:10:40,32
I don't think you do. I doubt it.

916
01:10:40,45 --> 01:10:44,82
So wherever you go and whatever you do, this money will be tracking you down for all time.

917
01:10:44,95 --> 01:10:48,24
And to ensure that it does, to keep interest alive...

918
01:10:48,37 --> 01:10:52,58
I'm running a full-page ad in every major newspaper every Sunday...

919
01:10:52,71 --> 01:10:54,67
for as long as it takes.

920
01:10:54,79 --> 01:10:59,09
But-- and this is your last chance--

921
01:10:59,21 --> 01:11:03,34
if you return my son alive, uninjured...

922
01:11:03,47 --> 01:11:05,18
I'll withdraw the bounty.

923
01:11:05,30 --> 01:11:08,89
With any luck, you can simply disappear.

924
01:11:09,02 --> 01:11:14,31
Understand-- you will never see this money. Not one dollar.

925
01:11:15,81 --> 01:11:17,98
So you still have a chance to do the right thing.

926
01:11:20,61 --> 01:11:24,70
If you don't, well, then God be with you because nobody else on this Earth will be.

927
01:11:24,82 --> 01:11:27,20
Well, he's got nerve.

928
01:11:30,83 --> 01:11:34,33
That's it.

929
01:11:34,46 --> 01:11:36,84
Well, there you have it, Rosanna. A shocking turn of events.

930
01:11:36,96 --> 01:11:39,46
The ransom has turned into a $2-million bounty.

931
01:11:39,59 --> 01:11:42,05
Tony, it's obviously a very dangerous situation.

932
01:11:42,17 --> 01:11:45,05
Anything could happen. Of course, we wish him the best of luck.

933
01:11:45,18 --> 01:11:49,76
Did you notice he, uh, described the kidnapper as a $2 million lottery ticket?

934
01:11:49,89 --> 01:11:52,52
- The stakes are high on this one. - Yeah, as you mentioned also--

935
01:11:57,36 --> 01:12:00,15
- Could you turn it off? Could you turn it off? - Mr Mullen also appealed to his son.

936
01:12:00,28 --> 01:12:02,86
He said, "Sean, if you're out there listening, I love you."

937
01:12:02,99 --> 01:12:05,74
- It was very heartbreaking. - Also, our producer is telling me, uh--

938
01:12:07,78 --> 01:12:11,08
- Yeah. - Mullen, you're a fool!

939
01:12:11,20 --> 01:12:13,08
Stupid ass!

940
01:12:16,04 --> 01:12:18,13
I'm proud of you!

941
01:12:20,09 --> 01:12:23,01
A pair of armed bandits held 'em up last night.

942
01:12:23,13 --> 01:12:27,39
Police say a pair of gun-toting crooks went into the Korean church at Murray Street...

943
01:12:27,51 --> 01:12:29,60
in Flushing last night and announced a robbery.

944
01:12:29,72 --> 01:12:32,47
- They took wallets, handbags-- - Hey, where'd they take the kid?

945
01:12:32,60 --> 01:12:34,89
You know. The place we said.

946
01:12:39,61 --> 01:12:41,36
I had to do this.

947
01:12:41,48 --> 01:12:43,74
You had to do this?

948
01:12:46,78 --> 01:12:49,70
You had to do this?

949
01:12:49,82 --> 01:12:52,83
Kate, please.

950
01:12:52,95 --> 01:12:56,83
I'm so scared, but I know if I give him the money, he'll kill Sean.

951
01:12:56,96 --> 01:12:59,58
- I would if I was him. - What did you just say?

952
01:12:59,71 --> 01:13:01,75
Just look at it from his point of view.

953
01:13:01,88 --> 01:13:04,63
You think you're smart. You've got everybody off balance.

954
01:13:04,76 --> 01:13:07,47
- You think you've got it all figured out. - You tryin' to screw me?

955
01:13:07,59 --> 01:13:11,05
And then suddenly, out of left field, the one thing you thought would never happen does.

956
01:13:11,18 --> 01:13:13,10
- We gotta end this. - What are you doin'?

957
01:13:13,22 --> 01:13:16,31
No ransom, no money, no profit. Nothing. Nothing but downside.

958
01:13:16,43 --> 01:13:21,56
Because you've got this boy's father-- he's coming on like a stark, raving mad lunatic.

959
01:13:21,69 --> 01:13:25,28
- You turned her around, didn't you? - I mean, the guy can piss $2 million...

960
01:13:25,40 --> 01:13:27,61
- but he's willing to risk everything just to fuck you up. - Don't!

961
01:13:27,74 --> 01:13:30,66
How can you negotiate with a lunatic like that, huh? You can't.

962
01:13:30,78 --> 01:13:33,83
- Now you're off balance. - Get down. Lay down!

963
01:13:33,95 --> 01:13:37,16
You wanna stay down there forever, maggot? Did I get my money?

964
01:13:37,29 --> 01:13:40,79
Pretty soon you realize if you don't return this kid in mint condition as soon as possible...

965
01:13:40,92 --> 01:13:43,38
you're gonna be the most hunted man on the face of the Earth.

966
01:13:43,50 --> 01:13:47,84
And this maniac will never, ever quit until he's got you.

967
01:13:47,97 --> 01:13:51,14
Nobody pulls out on me.

968
01:13:51,26 --> 01:13:53,85
You know me.

969
01:13:53,97 --> 01:13:57,02
This is my show. I say when it's over.

970
01:13:57,14 --> 01:13:59,52
- Take it back. - No. - Tell him that you were wrong.

971
01:13:59,64 --> 01:14:01,81
- Kate, no, I can't. No, Kate, there is no other way. None. - Take it back.

972
01:14:01,94 --> 01:14:05,19
- He's my son too, and I want you to pay him. - Kate. They will kill him.

973
01:14:05,32 --> 01:14:07,53
Please, all we have is each other.

974
01:14:07,65 --> 01:14:12,03
Do you think any of them-- Do you think they give-- It's just us.

975
01:14:12,16 --> 01:14:14,53
Do you think I don't want him back? ls that it?

976
01:14:14,66 --> 01:14:17,12
You think I wouldn't do absolutely everything in my power to get him back?

977
01:14:17,25 --> 01:14:22,21
I'd cut my arm off. I'd-- I want him back so bad.

978
01:14:22,33 --> 01:14:25,96
Katie, please. I don't think I can take this if you're not with me.

979
01:14:41,52 --> 01:14:43,40
Don't quit on me.

980
01:14:54,99 --> 01:14:57,99
Tom. Now--

981
01:15:01,46 --> 01:15:04,33
I think what you did was wrong.

982
01:15:04,46 --> 01:15:07,25
You put your son at greater risk.

983
01:15:07,38 --> 01:15:10,34
Now, I need you to withdraw that reward.

984
01:15:10,47 --> 01:15:13,22
Just pay this bastard.

985
01:15:13,34 --> 01:15:17,10
Now, I believe that you will get your son back.

986
01:15:17,22 --> 01:15:21,27
And when we do, we will nail this son of a bitch.

987
01:15:22,81 --> 01:15:26,44
Now, God forbid you don't...

988
01:15:26,56 --> 01:15:28,44
your son--

989
01:15:28,57 --> 01:15:31,61
I swear to you I will work on nothing else.

990
01:15:31,74 --> 01:15:34,11
If I have to, I will take a leave of absence from the FBl...

991
01:15:34,24 --> 01:15:36,87
and you can hire me as your personal security consultant.

992
01:15:36,99 --> 01:15:39,95
And I will work on this as long as I am physically able.

993
01:15:40,08 --> 01:15:41,96
- Lonnie, please. I-- - Tom.

994
01:15:42,08 --> 01:15:44,62
I never told anybody, any of my people...

995
01:15:44,75 --> 01:15:49,13
about you and Jackie Brown, the real truth of it, and maybe I never will.

996
01:15:51,80 --> 01:15:54,47
You think I'm worried about going to jail?

997
01:15:59,68 --> 01:16:03,06
Mayor Barresi today voiced his disapproval of Tom Mullen's decision.

998
01:16:03,18 --> 01:16:06,35
- Donna Hanover joins us later in the broadcast. - You, uh, care for an update?

999
01:16:06,48 --> 01:16:08,69
Oh, yeah.

1000
01:16:08,82 --> 01:16:13,44
Well, in the last two hours since your husband's TV thing, we've had 4,000 calls.

1001
01:16:13,57 --> 01:16:18,28
- And you know how many real, good, solid leads? - How many?

1002
01:16:18,41 --> 01:16:22,12
Zero. And every time one of these...

1003
01:16:22,25 --> 01:16:25,71
greedy little whack jobs calls...

1004
01:16:25,83 --> 01:16:29,21
that is one less agent looking for your child.

1005
01:16:29,34 --> 01:16:31,67
Now, I gotta tell you, Kate.

1006
01:16:31,80 --> 01:16:37,01
I have never been confronted with such an unbelievable act of sabotage...

1007
01:16:37,14 --> 01:16:39,14
by a parent toward the recovery of their child...

1008
01:16:39,26 --> 01:16:41,35
as what your husband pulled off here today.

1009
01:16:41,47 --> 01:16:46,52
It is all on you now to talk to your husband, get him to withdraw this money.

1010
01:16:46,64 --> 01:16:49,36
- Otherwise we are in deep trouble. - Withdraw the mo-- What if he's right?

1011
01:16:49,48 --> 01:16:54,07
What if they have no intention of returning Sean at all?

1012
01:16:54,19 --> 01:16:57,03
- I trust him. - You trust him?

1013
01:16:57,16 --> 01:17:00,49
Yeah. I believe in him.

1014
01:17:00,62 --> 01:17:03,37
I stick with Tom...

1015
01:17:03,49 --> 01:17:06,21
and we always manage to land on high ground.

1016
01:17:07,33 --> 01:17:10,38
High ground? Huh.

1017
01:17:12,38 --> 01:17:15,67
Like with the Jackie Brown situation?

1018
01:17:17,30 --> 01:17:19,39
Yeah.

1019
01:17:23,89 --> 01:17:27,73
What exactly did your husband tell you...

1020
01:17:27,85 --> 01:17:30,06
about Jackie Brown?

1021
01:17:38,32 --> 01:17:40,03
- David? - Yeah.

1022
01:17:40,16 --> 01:17:42,95
- Can I talk to you for a minute? - Yeah, sure.

1023
01:17:43,08 --> 01:17:47,25
Look, Hawkins said that if I can come up with the $2 million, that he'd work it so that I can make the drop.

1024
01:17:47,37 --> 01:17:49,92
- Come on, Kate-- - Now, all I can raise is about a half a million.

1025
01:17:50,04 --> 01:17:52,25
I know you have access to a discretionary fund.

1026
01:17:52,38 --> 01:17:54,25
Kate. Jesus, please. Listen, you should talk to Tom about this.

1027
01:17:54,38 --> 01:17:57,76
- This isn't about Tom. - Really. - This is Sean.

1028
01:17:57,88 --> 01:18:00,76
I'm doin' okay. I'm holdin' up all right.

1029
01:18:00,89 --> 01:18:02,85
Uh, Kate, l-l can't do it. All right?

1030
01:18:02,97 --> 01:18:04,89
I--

1031
01:18:06,72 --> 01:18:09,98
He told you not to give me any money, didn't he?

1032
01:18:10,10 --> 01:18:12,81
Kate, he's my boss. Okay?

1033
01:18:30,71 --> 01:18:32,58
Okay, eat this.

1034
01:18:35,13 --> 01:18:37,01
Thank you.

1035
01:18:46,39 --> 01:18:49,48
Again, I say if it were my kid, I would pay.

1036
01:18:49,60 --> 01:18:52,10
I like the idea, "Yeah, you want the money, come and get it."

1037
01:18:52,23 --> 01:18:54,98
And when he comes and gets it, I hope somebody cuts their heads off, you know?

1038
01:18:55,11 --> 01:18:59,82
I'd get my boys from the Bronx, and we'd just totally--

1039
01:18:59,94 --> 01:19:01,95
- Take care of him. - We'd mess him up big time.

1040
01:19:02,07 --> 01:19:04,70
I think he's risking his son's life.

1041
01:19:04,82 --> 01:19:07,24
I think he's a fool. His child's life is in danger.

1042
01:19:07,37 --> 01:19:09,25
Pay the money. Get on with your life.

1043
01:19:09,37 --> 01:19:13,33
I'd beg, borrow and steal, if I had to. He should pay.

1044
01:19:13,46 --> 01:19:15,34
What?

1045
01:19:15,46 --> 01:19:18,84
- A man calls me at my home today. - Mm-hmm.

1046
01:19:18,96 --> 01:19:22,05
He ask me to look in my mailbox.

1047
01:19:22,18 --> 01:19:25,68
He told me to give you this, and nobody else.

1048
01:19:25,80 --> 01:19:29,52
He said if the police know anything about this...

1049
01:19:29,64 --> 01:19:33,69
if Mr Mullen knows about this...

1050
01:19:33,81 --> 01:19:36,52
they'll kill Sean.

1051
01:19:36,65 --> 01:19:38,53
Okay.

1052
01:19:54,25 --> 01:19:55,25
Who is it?

1053
01:20:39,00 --> 01:20:41,50
Oh, God!

1054
01:20:42,88 --> 01:20:45,13
It's very simple.

1055
01:20:45,26 --> 01:20:48,76
I'm growing very, very tired of this bullshit.

1056
01:20:48,89 --> 01:20:52,72
- Then could you-- - Now it's up to you.

1057
01:20:52,85 --> 01:20:56,31
Get him to take back the reward and pay me my money...

1058
01:20:56,44 --> 01:21:01,07
or you're gonna find pieces of your little boy all over New York.

1059
01:21:01,19 --> 01:21:04,69
I'm not gonna waste a bullet.

1060
01:21:04,82 --> 01:21:07,74
I'm just gonna sharpen my knife.

1061
01:21:10,24 --> 01:21:14,00
Oh, God! Please!

1062
01:21:26,88 --> 01:21:29,68
And he never raised his voice at all, Kate?

1063
01:21:29,80 --> 01:21:32,18
No, he-- No, he was whispering.

1064
01:21:32,31 --> 01:21:35,02
I-- He was whispering.

1065
01:21:36,56 --> 01:21:38,98
Okay. Come on. We'll take it to the lab.

1066
01:21:42,15 --> 01:21:46,95
You paid off to save your airline.

1067
01:21:47,07 --> 01:21:49,82
Why won't you pay off to save your son?

1068
01:22:01,50 --> 01:22:05,63
I'm not a marriage counsellor. I'm here to get your boy back.

1069
01:22:27,78 --> 01:22:29,53
I'm sorry.

1070
01:22:31,24 --> 01:22:33,20
I hope...

1071
01:22:33,32 --> 01:22:35,91
that you can forgive me for that.

1072
01:22:39,58 --> 01:22:42,83
And for what I have to do now.

1073
01:22:44,67 --> 01:22:46,92
Get the shirt to Forensics.

1074
01:22:47,05 --> 01:22:49,72
- Make sure they check for more than one blood type. - Sure, Lonnie.

1075
01:22:49,84 --> 01:22:53,89
Where are you goin', Tom? Where are you goin'? What you--

1076
01:22:55,51 --> 01:22:57,39
I'm not-- All right.

1077
01:22:57,52 --> 01:23:00,73
Just think before you act.

1078
01:23:04,56 --> 01:23:06,98
- There he is. - Mr Mullen! - Mr Mullen!

1079
01:23:20,50 --> 01:23:22,96
- I'd like to make a statement. - Quiet.

1080
01:23:23,08 --> 01:23:27,42
And that is that I'm undeterred in my course of action.

1081
01:23:31,13 --> 01:23:33,13
And I'm raising the reward.

1082
01:23:33,26 --> 01:23:38,10
Uh, I'm raising it by $2 million.

1083
01:23:38,22 --> 01:23:41,77
- Mr Mullen, why are you doing this? - I want my son back.

1084
01:23:43,14 --> 01:23:45,48
Thank you. Thank you.

1085
01:23:45,61 --> 01:23:48,78
The FBl's efforts in this area--

1086
01:23:55,37 --> 01:23:59,74
This just in: Tom Mullen has reportedly raised the reward money for his son's life...

1087
01:23:59,87 --> 01:24:03,12
by $2 million.

1088
01:24:20,27 --> 01:24:22,93
Hey.

1089
01:24:23,06 --> 01:24:25,10
Where are you goin'?

1090
01:24:36,07 --> 01:24:38,16
You've ruined my life.

1091
01:24:39,83 --> 01:24:41,58
Who the hell you think I'm doing this for?

1092
01:24:41,87 --> 01:24:46,04
A stunning development tonight as Tom Mullen doubles the reward money...

1093
01:24:46,17 --> 01:24:48,96
to $4 million for the capture of--

1094
01:24:52,51 --> 01:24:54,92
- What? - Wanna talk to your son?

1095
01:24:56,22 --> 01:24:59,97
- Yes, of course I do. - Mmm, Daddy? Dad?

1096
01:25:00,10 --> 01:25:01,89
Sean.

1097
01:25:02,02 --> 01:25:05,89
- Sean. Sean. Son. - Sean? I wanna listen.

1098
01:25:06,02 --> 01:25:08,69
- That's enough. - No, put him back on. I wanna-- I wanna talk to him.

1099
01:25:08,81 --> 01:25:10,52
You just did.

1100
01:25:10,65 --> 01:25:14,03
Now, you listen...

1101
01:25:14,15 --> 01:25:16,74
real, real good.

1102
01:25:16,86 --> 01:25:20,53
You got one more chance to pay up or you're never gonna talk to him again.

1103
01:25:20,66 --> 01:25:22,95
No more fuckin' around.

1104
01:25:23,08 --> 01:25:25,71
This is it right now.

1105
01:25:25,83 --> 01:25:27,92
What's it gonna be?

1106
01:25:33,92 --> 01:25:37,76
No. Bullshit. You're not gonna touch him. You can't be that stupid.

1107
01:25:37,88 --> 01:25:40,09
Do you have any idea the rain of shit I can put on you?

1108
01:25:40,22 --> 01:25:44,93
Look at your wife. Look at her face, motherfucker. Do you know what I can do to your boy?

1109
01:25:45,06 --> 01:25:47,48
Is it dark where you're calling from? You got the shades drawn?

1110
01:25:47,60 --> 01:25:51,19
Kind of like a cellar, right? Like a cave? Well, you better get used to that.

1111
01:25:51,31 --> 01:25:53,44
You better get used to crawling in the dark for the rest of your days...

1112
01:25:53,57 --> 01:25:56,95
because I am going to get the best group of manhunters in this country...

1113
01:25:57,07 --> 01:25:59,28
and I am gonna dedicate my life to tracking you down!

1114
01:25:59,41 --> 01:26:01,45
- You understand? - Hey, hey, get your head out of your ass!

1115
01:26:01,57 --> 01:26:04,79
You think you can threaten me, huh? Who do you think you're dealing with? Give me the money!

1116
01:26:04,91 --> 01:26:10,00
Fuck you and your $2 million! Don't you understand English, you useless piece of shit? No money! None!

1117
01:26:10,12 --> 01:26:12,84
Let me tell you something. You think you're suffering right now? Huh?

1118
01:26:12,96 --> 01:26:17,42
You got no idea what suffering is. If I don't get the cash in one hour, this kid is dead!

1119
01:26:17,55 --> 01:26:21,18
I don't get my son back, and I mean real soon, you better kill yourself...

1120
01:26:21,30 --> 01:26:24,56
because when I catch up with you I'm gonna take my goddam time!

1121
01:26:24,68 --> 01:26:27,27
By the time we're finished, you're gonna wish you weren't born!

1122
01:26:27,39 --> 01:26:29,64
I'll have your head on a fuckin' pike! You understand me?

1123
01:26:29,77 --> 01:26:31,98
Fuck you! I'll fuckin' kill him right now!

1124
01:26:32,11 --> 01:26:35,07
- I wanna talk! - You kill him, you kill yourself, you motherfucker!

1125
01:26:35,19 --> 01:26:37,69
- Give me back my son! - Hello!

1126
01:26:37,82 --> 01:26:40,57
- You want him? - Yes! - You want him?

1127
01:26:40,70 --> 01:26:42,41
Daddy!

1128
01:26:42,53 --> 01:26:45,49
Oh! Jesus! Jesus!

1129
01:26:45,62 --> 01:26:49,16
Oh, Jesus! Oh! Oh!

1130
01:26:49,29 --> 01:26:51,71
Oh! Oh, God!

1131
01:26:56,75 --> 01:27:00,88
I'll fuckin' kill you, Mullen!

1132
01:27:06,47 --> 01:27:12,15
You son of a bitch! You killed him, you son of a bitch! Goddam it!

1133
01:27:12,27 --> 01:27:15,52
- Whoa, whoa. - Oh, God. Oh, God. - Come on. Easy. Come on. - Kate!

1134
01:27:15,65 --> 01:27:19,19
- Both of you listen to me! - You killed him! Not them! You!

1135
01:27:19,32 --> 01:27:21,65
No, Kate! Kate. Okay, it's all right.

1136
01:27:21,78 --> 01:27:24,74
- Take her in the other room. - Oh, God! Oh, God!

1137
01:27:24,87 --> 01:27:27,41
- Oh, God. I wanted to talk to him. - I know.

1138
01:27:27,54 --> 01:27:31,33
- I wanted to talk to him. - You'll talk to him, honey. You will. You will.

1139
01:27:37,13 --> 01:27:39,55
- What do we do about this kid? - Ain't my problem any more.

1140
01:27:39,67 --> 01:27:41,88
Can't ID anybody, right? Fuck 'im.

1141
01:28:16,84 --> 01:28:18,59
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1142
01:28:18,71 --> 01:28:22,22
Oh, please, help me. Please.

1143
01:28:22,34 --> 01:28:25,43
Okay, Katie, all right. It's okay. It's okay.

1144
01:28:25,55 --> 01:28:27,89
Oh, God. Oh, no.

1145
01:29:38,71 --> 01:29:42,13
- Ohh! Ohh! - Oh, Tom.

1146
01:30:25,05 --> 01:30:27,55
South 44 to Base.

1147
01:30:27,67 --> 01:30:30,89
- Oh, God. Oh, God. - South 44, go.

1148
01:30:31,01 --> 01:30:35,39
2627 18th Street. 10-13. Officer needs assistance.

1149
01:30:35,52 --> 01:30:38,31
I have several armed men in a house. Possible kidnap situation.

1150
01:30:38,43 --> 01:30:40,60
Repeat, possible kidnap situation.

1151
01:30:40,73 --> 01:30:43,86
10-13. Officer in civilian clothes.

1152
01:31:06,67 --> 01:31:08,76
- Police! - Shit.

1153
01:31:11,13 --> 01:31:14,72
- Get the fuck out of the van! - Go, man. Come on.

1154
01:31:34,53 --> 01:31:36,58
Drop the gun!

1155
01:33:10,84 --> 01:33:13,34
Move! Move! Go!

1156
01:33:19,01 --> 01:33:21,10
Clear!

1157
01:33:21,22 --> 01:33:22,89
Clear!

1158
01:33:23,02 --> 01:33:26,56
- Police! Freeze! - Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm a cop!

1159
01:33:26,69 --> 01:33:29,23
- Clear! - Hold your fire. I'm a cop.

1160
01:33:29,36 --> 01:33:31,23
He's all right.

1161
01:33:32,90 --> 01:33:34,78
I'm a cop.

1162
01:33:40,07 --> 01:33:41,95
Kate. Tom.

1163
01:33:49,71 --> 01:33:51,59
FBl. Comin' through. Comin' through.

1164
01:33:51,71 --> 01:33:54,59
Stay with me. Stay with me. Comin' through, fellas. Comin' through.

1165
01:33:59,22 --> 01:34:01,10
Wh-- Where is-- Where is--

1166
01:34:02,72 --> 01:34:04,89
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1167
01:34:06,18 --> 01:34:08,06
Wh-Where is-- L-Lonnie? Where's Sean?

1168
01:34:08,19 --> 01:34:10,81
In the house. In the house. Right over here.

1169
01:34:10,94 --> 01:34:13,90
Don't stop here, guys. Keep movin' all the way through.

1170
01:34:14,03 --> 01:34:16,95
-Clear the doorway here, okay? -The boy's in there. -All right, here comes the boy's father.

1171
01:34:17,07 --> 01:34:19,78
Sean? Sean? I'm-- I'm the father.

1172
01:34:19,91 --> 01:34:22,45
Sean?

1173
01:34:22,58 --> 01:34:26,12
- Who is it? - Sean. It's me. It's Daddy.

1174
01:34:26,25 --> 01:34:28,54
Daddy?

1175
01:34:28,67 --> 01:34:31,17
Is he-- Is he all right? C-Can I pick him up?

1176
01:34:31,29 --> 01:34:33,17
- Can I hold him? - Oh, he's gonna be all right. - Oh, Sean.

1177
01:34:33,29 --> 01:34:36,30
He's just got a nasty cut on his hand, and he's, uh, a little dehydrated.

1178
01:34:36,42 --> 01:34:39,05
- Sean, it's Mommy. - You're okay, buddy. You're okay. We got ya.

1179
01:34:39,18 --> 01:34:40,80
- We got ya now. - Hi, Mom.

1180
01:34:40,93 --> 01:34:43,89
- Hi, sweetheart. - You're okay.

1181
01:34:45,18 --> 01:34:48,69
- Take me home, okay? - Oh, sure. Sure.

1182
01:34:48,81 --> 01:34:51,31
- Take me home. - Okay, honey.

1183
01:34:53,69 --> 01:34:55,57
- I love you, Sean. - Me too.

1184
01:35:04,41 --> 01:35:06,62
Mama's here, Sean.

1185
01:35:09,21 --> 01:35:11,08
You're okay.

1186
01:35:19,84 --> 01:35:21,76
-Is-ls-ls-ls he seriously injured? -Here's your man. He's right over there.

1187
01:35:21,89 --> 01:35:24,35
He's gonna be okay. Step to the side, please.

1188
01:35:24,47 --> 01:35:28,98
- All the way to the right. - Lieutenant, we-- - All the way back. Get back. - Back off.

1189
01:35:29,10 --> 01:35:30,64
- Mr Shaker? - Step back, please. Step back. Step back.

1190
01:35:30,77 --> 01:35:33,40
Did you get a chance to talk to him?

1191
01:35:33,52 --> 01:35:36,69
- I said step back. - Thank you. - Call it justice. It's a department courtesy.

1192
01:35:42,61 --> 01:35:44,70
- All right, now, if you please. - Move. Move.

1193
01:35:44,82 --> 01:35:46,70
- Guys, help us out, will ya? - Thank you.

1194
01:35:48,33 --> 01:35:50,58
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

1195
01:35:50,71 --> 01:35:54,75
Tom. Tom? Just come this way.

1196
01:35:54,88 --> 01:35:56,75
What-- What-- Mr Mullen!

1197
01:35:59,30 --> 01:36:02,38
You know her?

1198
01:36:02,51 --> 01:36:04,76
Yeah.

1199
01:36:04,89 --> 01:36:06,60
I do.

1200
01:36:08,22 --> 01:36:11,27
Jesus Christ. I mean, she w-worked for me.

1201
01:36:11,39 --> 01:36:13,48
Catering.

1202
01:36:16,48 --> 01:36:18,53
Please, sir! Here!

1203
01:36:20,53 --> 01:36:24,03
- Mr Mullen! Tom! Tom! - Mr Mullen, this way! - Mr Mullen, this way!

1204
01:36:24,16 --> 01:36:28,58
Wait! This way! Right here! Right here! Look over here, please!

1205
01:36:28,70 --> 01:36:31,45
- You okay? - Not now. Come on, back off.

1206
01:36:31,58 --> 01:36:34,37
Not now. Leave 'em alone.

1207
01:36:34,50 --> 01:36:36,96
- Give us a break now! - Sean, here!

1208
01:36:37,09 --> 01:36:41,38
-Sean! Mr Mullen! -Mr Mullen, this way! Mr Mullen, please!

1209
01:36:41,51 --> 01:36:44,43
Aaah! Turn the lights on! Turn the lights on!

1210
01:36:44,55 --> 01:36:46,85
- Hey. - It's all right.

1211
01:36:46,97 --> 01:36:49,97
- I'm afraid of the dark. I don't like the dark. - You're all right.

1212
01:36:50,10 --> 01:36:54,27
- Leave the light on. - Yeah, we'll leave 'em on. We'll leave 'em on all the time.

1213
01:36:54,39 --> 01:36:56,35
Okay?

1214
01:36:56,48 --> 01:37:00,69
Next thing I know, one guy starts blastin' away at me.

1215
01:37:00,82 --> 01:37:05,70
The-- The other guy, he goes to run me over.

1216
01:37:05,82 --> 01:37:09,37
So, you know, I just did what I had to do.

1217
01:37:09,49 --> 01:37:11,37
What about the woman?

1218
01:37:14,41 --> 01:37:16,29
Jimmy?

1219
01:37:18,67 --> 01:37:22,17
Uh, you know, I just, uh, got spun around by the bullet.

1220
01:37:22,30 --> 01:37:25,01
I didn't know it was a woman 'til after.

1221
01:37:31,68 --> 01:37:34,10
He's a, an honest cop. He does a hell of a job.

1222
01:37:34,23 --> 01:37:36,06
- He's kind of a to-himself type of a guy. - No, just one.

1223
01:37:36,19 --> 01:37:37,65
- But I tell you what, when the chips are down... - Cancel the other one.

1224
01:37:37,77 --> 01:37:40,27
this is the one I'd want with me.

1225
01:37:40,40 --> 01:37:42,61
- How do I feel? - No. - I'll tell ya, this is the second time...

1226
01:37:42,73 --> 01:37:44,61
- Jimmy Shaker's been shot. - Just one-way.

1227
01:37:44,74 --> 01:37:47,49
He got clipped once before in 1992, and this guy keeps coming back.

1228
01:37:47,61 --> 01:37:50,37
Yeah. Uh, Mr Kinney. Yeah. Thanks.

1229
01:37:50,49 --> 01:37:53,04
Continuing our coverage of the Mullen kidnapping case...

1230
01:37:53,16 --> 01:37:56,29
questions still surround Maris Conner.

1231
01:37:56,41 --> 01:38:00,67
With no prior criminal record, authorities are interrogating family and friends...

1232
01:38:00,79 --> 01:38:05,13
seeking any associations that would connect her to the other slain suspects.

1233
01:38:05,26 --> 01:38:08,51
Sources reveal today that the investigation continues...

1234
01:38:08,64 --> 01:38:11,89
and the search for other suspects is by no means over.

1235
01:38:12,01 --> 01:38:15,77
Many investigators believe that, indeed, the mastermind of the Mullen kidnapping...

1236
01:38:15,89 --> 01:38:17,77
may still be at large.

1237
01:38:17,89 --> 01:38:21,48
- Whoa! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1238
01:38:21,61 --> 01:38:24,40
- We can make it. - Oh, sh-- - Ohh!

1239
01:38:24,53 --> 01:38:26,99
- You cold, honey? - Yeah. My hands.

1240
01:38:27,11 --> 01:38:29,24
- Do you wanna go home? - I didn't bring my gloves. - No. No. No.

1241
01:38:29,36 --> 01:38:31,82
You sure? Hey, you're squinting a little. Is the sun still bothering you?

1242
01:38:31,95 --> 01:38:33,83
- Put these on. - Yeah.

1243
01:38:33,95 --> 01:38:36,33
- I'll go get your gloves. - Okay.

1244
01:38:36,45 --> 01:38:38,62
You'd better practise. I'll be back.

1245
01:38:40,63 --> 01:38:44,05
Look at me. You look good in those, honey.

1246
01:38:44,17 --> 01:38:46,09
- Look at my glasses. Can you see? - Mm-hmm.

1247
01:38:46,21 --> 01:38:47,92
Look like your daddy in those.

1248
01:38:48,22 --> 01:38:52,47
Well, David, it's a little hard to focus right now. Can it wait?

1249
01:38:52,60 --> 01:38:56,10
No? Well, the hell with it, then. Let him have it. Let it go.

1250
01:38:56,22 --> 01:38:59,73
Yeah. Listen, I got Sean waitin' for me in the park, so maybe we--

1251
01:38:59,85 --> 01:39:01,27
- Hey. - Hey. - Hey.

1252
01:39:01,40 --> 01:39:03,27
Uh, I'll call you back, David. Call you back.

1253
01:39:03,40 --> 01:39:06,44
- Mr Mullen. - Uh-- - The doorman just called up.

1254
01:39:06,57 --> 01:39:09,32
- Mr Shaker wants to see you. - Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry to show up like this.

1255
01:39:09,45 --> 01:39:11,53
Oh, hell, no. Come in. I-l wanna talk to you.

1256
01:39:11,66 --> 01:39:14,78
- Thanks. - Come in. Come in. How's the shoulder?

1257
01:39:14,91 --> 01:39:16,87
Ahh, you know. I'll live.

1258
01:39:17,00 --> 01:39:19,04
Yeah. Well, I'm surprised to see you up and about so quick.

1259
01:39:19,16 --> 01:39:22,08
- Uh, uh, Fatima, this is, uh, Jimmy Shaker. - Hi.

1260
01:39:22,21 --> 01:39:24,96
I'm very proud to meet you.

1261
01:39:25,09 --> 01:39:26,96
- Very proud. - Thanks.

1262
01:39:30,01 --> 01:39:32,14
How's the, uh, kid doin'?

1263
01:39:32,26 --> 01:39:34,85
Oh, he's fine, you know, all things considered.

1264
01:39:34,97 --> 01:39:37,18
- It'll take a while. - Yeah.

1265
01:39:38,77 --> 01:39:40,69
Um, uh, forgive me.

1266
01:39:40,81 --> 01:39:44,27
I, uh, I thought we were gonna meet on Monday. M-Maybe I screwed up. I don't-- I--

1267
01:39:44,40 --> 01:39:48,65
Uh, yeah, uh, you're right. Monday. We-- That's what we said, uh--

1268
01:39:48,78 --> 01:39:51,15
See the special officer holding 4-5-9--

1269
01:39:53,87 --> 01:39:57,37
Look, I don't want you to get the wrong impression of me here...

1270
01:39:57,49 --> 01:40:02,25
but I was hopin' we could do this today.

1271
01:40:02,37 --> 01:40:04,92
- You know, the reward and all? - Oh. Of course. Oh, Jesus. - 'Cause I gotta tell ya...

1272
01:40:05,04 --> 01:40:08,76
it's, uh, kinda crazy around me, you know, with the, the press and everything.

1273
01:40:08,88 --> 01:40:11,01
Oh, I understand. Yeah. Look, they're maniacs.

1274
01:40:11,13 --> 01:40:13,51
- Yeah. - Nothin' easier. Follow me.

1275
01:40:13,64 --> 01:40:17,60
I'm not used to this, you know. I-- I just gotta get outta here.

1276
01:40:19,18 --> 01:40:23,69
Kind of a private person, you know.

1277
01:40:23,81 --> 01:40:27,90
To tell you the truth, I never killed anybody before.

1278
01:40:28,02 --> 01:40:30,36
Havin' a hard time with it.

1279
01:40:31,57 --> 01:40:33,70
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

1280
01:40:33,82 --> 01:40:36,95
Uh, I'm glad you did what you did.

1281
01:40:38,49 --> 01:40:40,37
But I'm sorry.

1282
01:40:41,66 --> 01:40:44,04
- Sit down, please. - Thanks.

1283
01:40:44,17 --> 01:40:48,21
Uh, so, is it, uh-- is it Jimmy? James?

1284
01:40:49,80 --> 01:40:51,67
James.

1285
01:40:55,01 --> 01:40:56,55
James'll do.

1286
01:41:13,24 --> 01:41:16,57
- Can I ask you a personal question? - Sure.

1287
01:41:18,37 --> 01:41:20,79
Why didn't you pay the ransom?

1288
01:41:23,33 --> 01:41:26,75
Well, because I was dealing with human garbage.

1289
01:41:26,88 --> 01:41:29,92
No contract would have been honoured, not by them.

1290
01:41:30,04 --> 01:41:32,26
You know, the funny thing is, I would have paid ten times as much...

1291
01:41:32,38 --> 01:41:35,55
if I had any sense that they'd stick to the deal, but no.

1292
01:41:35,68 --> 01:41:37,55
- Really. - Oh, yeah. Really.

1293
01:41:40,89 --> 01:41:42,81
The thing that really kills me about that is the woman.

1294
01:41:42,93 --> 01:41:46,44
She'd been in this house five, six times over the last year. Nice. Pleasant. You know.

1295
01:41:46,56 --> 01:41:48,69
You just can't, uh--

1296
01:41:48,81 --> 01:41:51,61
I-l don't know how people can walk around with that--

1297
01:41:51,73 --> 01:41:54,61
That cold-blooded, two-faced--

1298
01:41:54,74 --> 01:41:57,11
That bitch.

1299
01:41:57,24 --> 01:42:00,62
Well, uh, you know, in fairness to the dead...

1300
01:42:00,74 --> 01:42:03,79
we're all a little two-faced in this day and age.

1301
01:42:07,25 --> 01:42:09,88
It's a survival mechanism. You kn-- You know what I'm saying?

1302
01:42:16,42 --> 01:42:19,59
I mean, you know, as a cop...

1303
01:42:19,72 --> 01:42:22,85
you should hear some of the stuff that's been thrown my way over the years.

1304
01:42:22,97 --> 01:42:26,06
Tom, just forget about the gloves, honey. He wanted to come home.

1305
01:42:26,18 --> 01:42:29,65
- Kate, uh-- - Hi, Tom. - Mr Shaker's here.

1306
01:42:29,77 --> 01:42:32,02
Mr Shaker.

1307
01:42:36,82 --> 01:42:39,03
Ohh, um--

1308
01:42:44,16 --> 01:42:46,66
God bless you. Uh, thank you.

1309
01:42:48,62 --> 01:42:51,00
- You're welcome. - Listen, you-- you gotta meet Sean.

1310
01:42:51,13 --> 01:42:52,92
I'll go get him.

1311
01:42:53,04 --> 01:42:57,72
No, uh, he's, you know, had enough. Let's give him a breather. Yeah?

1312
01:43:01,64 --> 01:43:04,56
Yeah, yeah. He's-He's had enough.

1313
01:43:04,68 --> 01:43:07,02
Okay. Uh, can I get you anything?

1314
01:43:07,14 --> 01:43:09,10
No, I'm fine.

1315
01:43:09,23 --> 01:43:11,19
Oh, well, again, l-- I can't even begin to--

1316
01:43:11,31 --> 01:43:13,77
I understand. Don't mention it.

1317
01:43:15,65 --> 01:43:17,03
Okay.

1318
01:43:19,65 --> 01:43:23,03
Fatima, would you please help me with some things downstairs?

1319
01:43:23,16 --> 01:43:26,12
I'll be right there.

1320
01:43:32,33 --> 01:43:35,25
Well, this is, uh, one hell of a deposit you've got here.

1321
01:43:36,38 --> 01:43:39,13
Shouldn't be a problem.

1322
01:43:48,68 --> 01:43:51,23
Well, you'll probably wanna be on your way.

1323
01:43:51,35 --> 01:43:54,23
Uh, unless there's anything else I can do for you.

1324
01:43:58,90 --> 01:44:00,74
Good. Right.

1325
01:44:00,86 --> 01:44:04,91
Well, I know how these vultures out there can drive ya nuts, so--

1326
01:44:05,03 --> 01:44:08,20
You know, there's a back door out if you, you know, wanna be a little more s--

1327
01:44:08,33 --> 01:44:11,87
This check is bullshit, Tom.

1328
01:44:12,00 --> 01:44:16,50
What'd you think, I'm just gonna waltz outta here, you lying motherfucker? Huh?

1329
01:44:16,63 --> 01:44:21,88
Let you make a phone call, have half the cops in New York waitin' for me while I cash this thing?

1330
01:44:22,01 --> 01:44:23,89
- You can't lie to me. - Look--

1331
01:44:24,01 --> 01:44:26,26
Shut your mouth.

1332
01:44:28,64 --> 01:44:30,52
Fuck!

1333
01:44:41,32 --> 01:44:45,07
You know who I am. Now you sit down.

1334
01:44:46,82 --> 01:44:50,41
Everybody was gonna make out fine.

1335
01:44:50,54 --> 01:44:53,00
But you had to go and put it together...

1336
01:44:53,12 --> 01:44:58,59
and now we got a little problem here, don't we?

1337
01:44:58,71 --> 01:45:01,17
Tell me that part again about why you didn't pay the ransom.

1338
01:45:01,30 --> 01:45:03,26
- I think we can do something here-- - Say it!

1339
01:45:03,38 --> 01:45:05,80
You were dealing with what?

1340
01:45:07,97 --> 01:45:12,48
- You had my son. - You have no idea what human garbage is, motherfucker.

1341
01:45:12,60 --> 01:45:15,60
Do you know what the fuck you're talking about? No, I don't think you do.

1342
01:45:15,73 --> 01:45:19,98
'Cause look where you fuckin' live, man. Look at the airline man here.

1343
01:45:20,11 --> 01:45:23,99
This fucker won't pay one cent to save his only kid.

1344
01:45:24,11 --> 01:45:27,57
- It wasn't gonna get him back, was it? - Hey, did you read the papers? Huh?

1345
01:45:27,70 --> 01:45:29,58
Did you see the TV?

1346
01:45:29,70 --> 01:45:33,04
I took a bullet. I risked my life to save your kid.

1347
01:45:33,16 --> 01:45:36,71
I took a bullet, and now you're gonna try to fuck me out of my money. Huh?

1348
01:45:36,83 --> 01:45:39,71
- What's over here? - Where are you going? - Where's Mommy and Junior?

1349
01:45:39,84 --> 01:45:42,88
- Now I'll pay. Now. - Oh, yeah.

1350
01:45:43,01 --> 01:45:46,47
You're gonna pay, all right. Right now.

1351
01:45:46,59 --> 01:45:49,89
Do you have an account I can wire the money to? I mean, you got to have been all set up for this, right?

1352
01:45:50,01 --> 01:45:54,48
I mean, you're not dumb. You and me, we go right now to my bank...

1353
01:45:54,60 --> 01:45:56,56
and we wire the money from my account to yours.

1354
01:45:56,69 --> 01:45:58,90
Just the push of a button. Just like that.

1355
01:45:59,02 --> 01:46:03,74
We'll just go down to the bank and get it done.

1356
01:46:03,86 --> 01:46:06,74
Pick up the phone. Wire it from here.

1357
01:46:09,62 --> 01:46:13,24
Uh, no, we'll go to the bank and do it.

1358
01:46:13,37 --> 01:46:17,75
And you'll get the money and all I want in return is you out of this house now.

1359
01:46:21,13 --> 01:46:24,38
Hey. You do not call the shots.

1360
01:46:24,51 --> 01:46:29,01
Well, then, you just go ahead and kill me right here and now, you son of a bitch.

1361
01:46:29,14 --> 01:46:32,43
You fuck! Fuck you! I'm not pickin' up that phone.

1362
01:46:32,56 --> 01:46:35,64
You got that? I'm not pickin' it up.

1363
01:46:35,77 --> 01:46:39,69
Look, uh, you can kill me. Go ahead. Kill me. Just kill us.

1364
01:46:39,81 --> 01:46:42,40
Let us live. Doesn't matter. Any way you cut it, you're on the run.

1365
01:46:42,52 --> 01:46:45,74
Now, you can come with me to the bank and be on the run with $4 million...

1366
01:46:45,86 --> 01:46:49,66
or you can just start shootin' and be on the run with whatever you got in your wallet.

1367
01:46:49,78 --> 01:46:51,66
It's up to you.

1368
01:46:51,78 --> 01:46:56,16
Come on, Jimmy. Let's go to the bank. Oh, Jesus Christ.

1369
01:46:56,29 --> 01:47:00,29
I got what I want. Bottom line: I got my son back.

1370
01:47:00,42 --> 01:47:02,63
And you d-- you delivered him.

1371
01:47:02,75 --> 01:47:07,13
I got my own plane. I can fly you out of here myself anywhere you wanna go.

1372
01:47:07,26 --> 01:47:11,72
You can still win this thing. Think. You can still win.

1373
01:47:30,28 --> 01:47:32,45
We do what you say. We go to the bank.

1374
01:47:32,57 --> 01:47:38,25
If anything goes wrong, you're gonna turn around and I'll be gone.

1375
01:47:38,37 --> 01:47:40,83
Okay? And if that happens...

1376
01:47:40,96 --> 01:47:43,00
from this day on...

1377
01:47:43,13 --> 01:47:46,25
any time your kid leaves this house to go to school...

1378
01:47:46,38 --> 01:47:50,18
go play, see a friend...

1379
01:47:50,30 --> 01:47:53,51
to buy a fuckin' comic book, you're gonna have to ask yourself:

1380
01:47:55,51 --> 01:47:58,06
Is today...

1381
01:47:58,18 --> 01:48:00,69
Jimmy Shaker day?

1382
01:48:00,81 --> 01:48:03,56
I got to him once.

1383
01:48:03,69 --> 01:48:06,15
I'll get him again.

1384
01:48:06,27 --> 01:48:09,07
And when I do...

1385
01:48:09,19 --> 01:48:12,95
I'm not gonna want money any more.

1386
01:48:13,07 --> 01:48:15,66
Do we understand each other?

1387
01:48:15,78 --> 01:48:17,12
Sure.

1388
01:48:36,76 --> 01:48:38,22
That's from Maris.

1389
01:48:45,94 --> 01:48:47,82
Call the airport.

1390
01:48:53,99 --> 01:48:56,03
Where are we goin'?

1391
01:48:56,16 --> 01:48:58,58
Mexico. Guadalajara.

1392
01:49:03,29 --> 01:49:08,63
David, this is Tom. Uh, fuel up the jet. I'm going to Guadalajara.

1393
01:49:08,75 --> 01:49:11,92
Yeah, well, something came up. I'm on my way to the bank now.

1394
01:49:14,38 --> 01:49:16,43
- Is the kidnapper with you? - Absolutely.

1395
01:49:18,89 --> 01:49:21,89
I'll explain everything later. Give Katie a call. Bye.

1396
01:49:23,98 --> 01:49:25,85
Antone, get me the Mullen house.

1397
01:49:25,98 --> 01:49:28,19
Sean, what's the matter, honey?

1398
01:49:29,73 --> 01:49:31,86
Come here.

1399
01:49:33,74 --> 01:49:36,11
Taxi! Taxi!

1400
01:49:40,24 --> 01:49:42,12
Stay on my right.

1401
01:49:44,04 --> 01:49:46,29
What are you guys doin'? You can't park there.

1402
01:49:46,42 --> 01:49:48,63
Oh, we're just goin' to the bank. Five minutes.

1403
01:49:50,63 --> 01:49:52,80
- Shaker? - Yeah.

1404
01:49:55,59 --> 01:49:57,47
- How you doin', Jimmy? - How are ya?

1405
01:49:57,59 --> 01:49:59,85
