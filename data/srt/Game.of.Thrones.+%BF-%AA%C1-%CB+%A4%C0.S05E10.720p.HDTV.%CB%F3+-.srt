1
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,530
Brace the wind.

2
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,980
The lord of light has made good on his promise, my king.

3
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,500
His fires have melted the snows away.

4
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,620
The way ahead is clear.

5
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,200
We ride for Winterfell.

6
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,840
And you will take it.

7
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,340
The lord has shown me Bolton Banners burning.

8
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,310
You will receive what is yours by right.

9
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,510
Your grace.

10
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,590
Prepare to form up.

11
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,600
Your grace.

12
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,930
Tell me.

13
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,780
The men, many deserted before dawn.

14
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,390
How many?

15
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,310
Nearly half.

16
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,900
All the sellswords with all the horses.

17
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,810
Your grace.

18
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,610
Speak up. Can't be worse than mutiny.

19
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,980
Cut her down.

20
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,700
Your grace.

21
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,500
The lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.

22
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,180
Get the men into marching formation.

23
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,520
On to Winterfell.

24
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,020
He raised his hands

25
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,630
and they all stood up at once.

26
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,640
Tens of thousands of them. The biggest army in the world.

27
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,760
So what are you gonna do?

28
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,550
I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the Wall.

29
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,010
But the dragonglass...

30
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,190
No one's ever getting that back now.

31
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,420
It wouldn't have mattered anyway.

32
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,950
Not unless we had a mountain of it.

33
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,780
But you killed a white walker.

34
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,230
With Longclaw.

35
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,990
I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass.

36
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,960
- But Longclaw... - is Valyrian steel.

37
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,700
How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?

38
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,000
Not enough.

39
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,120
The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice

40
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,930
the lives of sworn brothers to save the lives of wildlings.

41
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,920
How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?

42
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,060
You were friends with me when I first came here.

43
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,340
And I wasn't winning any elections back then.

44
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,850
Here's to us, then.

45
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,660
Long may they sneer.

46
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,050
What?

47
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,930
I wanted to ask you something.

48
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,470
To ask something of you.

49
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,700
Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown

50
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,360
so I can become a maester.

51
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,490
That's what I'm meant to be. Not this.

52
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,450
I need you here, Sam.

53
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,150
If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?

54
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,830
Well, there's Edd.

55
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,630
I'd be more use to you as a maester.

56
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,770
More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon is gone.

57
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,560
The Citadel has the world's greatest library.

58
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,970
I'll learn about history,

59
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,890
strategy, healing.

60
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,080
And other things,

61
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,140
things that will help when--

62
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,860
when they come.

63
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,190
If Gilly stays here, then she'll die.

64
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,530
And the baby that she named after me will die.

65
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,420
And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them.

66
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,510
Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world

67
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,490
will be the look in her eyes when I fail them.

68
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,190
And I'd rather see a thousand white walkers than see that.

69
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,660
Thank you.

70
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,040
You know that the Citadel will make you swear off women, too.

71
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,900
Oh, they'll bloody try.

72
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,410
- Sam. - What?

73
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,970
Sam.

74
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,520
You had just been beaten half to death. How did you--

75
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,340
Oh, very carefully.

76
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,930
I'm glad the end of the world's working out well for someone.

77
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,600
I'll come back.

78
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,960
To your return.

79
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,250
To my return.

80
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,050
Aye, this way.

81
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,050
My lady!

82
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,240
Stannis.

83
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,110
Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.

84
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,370
How do you know it's Stannis?

85
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,350
They're carrying his flaming heart banners.

86
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,870
From the Blackwater. I'll never forget it.

87
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,370
Trench here.

88
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,170
Another one 300 yards from the castle wall.

89
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,380
Hurry them along.

90
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,200
Dig between those two rises.

91
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,020
- Spread out. - I'm with you.

92
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,490
- Archers! - Spread out!

93
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,850
And send out a foraging party immediately.

94
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,610
Siege begins at sunrise.

95
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,990
There's not going to be a siege, Your Grace.

96
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,340
We've got no chance!

97
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,670
No, please, please.

98
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,250
Bolton has women fighting for him?

99
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,610
I don't fight for the Boltons.

100
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,740
I'm Brienne of Tarth.

101
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,620
I was kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.

102
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,450
I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face.

103
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,970
You murdered him with blood magic?

104
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,840
I did.

105
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,260
In the name of Renly of house Baratheon, first of his name,

106
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,690
rightful king of the Andals and the First Men,

107
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,970
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm,

108
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,510
I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die.

109
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,240
Do you have any last words?

110
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,260
Go on, do your duty.

111
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,320
Looks like we're done here.

112
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,260
I surrender! I surrender!

113
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,330
And I accept your surrender.

114
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,160
Let's head back.

115
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,280
My wife must be lonely.

116
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,410
My lady.

117
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,780
I've come to escort you back to your chamber.

118
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,460
Go with her, please.

119
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,000
I know what Ramsay is.

120
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,220
I know what he'll do to me.

121
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,290
If I'm going to die,

122
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,190
let it happen while there's still some of me left.

123
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,400
Die?

124
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,420
Who said anything about dying?

125
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,930
You can't die.

126
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,030
Your father was Warden of the North.

127
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,400
Ramsay needs you.

128
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,330
Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you.

129
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,820
Just the parts he'll use to make his heir,

130
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,240
until you've given him a boy or two and he's finished using them.

131
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,660
Then he's got incredible plans for those parts.

132
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,300
So, shall we wait for him to come back

133
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,900
or should we begin now?

134
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,830
You're leaving it to me?

135
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,780
Good.

136
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,920
Let's begin.

137
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,350
Reek... stop!

138
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,110
Stop!

139
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,230
Open the gate!

140
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,370
He's coming back.

141
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,750
I can see I have my work cut out for me.

142
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,990
You two, out.

143
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,170
You were the first person on my list, you know.

144
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,690
For killing Syrio Forel. Remember him?

145
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,840
Probably not.

146
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,980
I've gotten a few of the others.

147
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,010
The many-faced god stole a few more from me.

148
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,210
But I'm glad he left me you.

149
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,780
Do you know who I am?

150
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,600
I can't hear you.

151
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,610
You know who I am.

152
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,500
I'm Arya Stark.

153
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,770
Do you know who you are?

154
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,320
You're no one.

155
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,700
You're nothing.

156
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,660
A girl has taken a life.

157
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,340
The wrong life.

158
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,930
I was right about her.

159
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,090
You were.

160
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,860
You're not ready.

161
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,450
Not at all.

162
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,170
That man's life was not yours to take.

163
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,140
A girl stole from the many-faced god.

164
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,260
Now a debt is owed.

165
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,740
Only death can pay for life.

166
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,090
No! No!

167
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,530
No, you... don't die! Don't die!

168
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,210
Why are you crying?

169
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,280
He was my friend.

170
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,890
No, he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?

171
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,570
He was no one.

172
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,390
But if you're...

173
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,600
Who's this?

174
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,460
No one at all.

175
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,270
Just as a girl should have been

176
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,170
before she took a face from the hall.

177
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,140
The faces are for no one.

178
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,080
You are still someone.

179
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,480
And to someone,

180
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,910
the faces are as good as poison.

181
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,210
I can't see.

182
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,870
What's happening?

183
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,910
What's happening?!

184
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,330
- I wish you a safe journey home. - Thank you.

185
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,870
Forgive me, child.

186
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,500
I wish you all the happiness in the world.

187
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,000
Maybe I'll come visit you sometime.

188
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,190
Maybe I'll come visit you.

189
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,670
Don't wait too long.

190
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,960
Got a noblewoman to marry back home.

191
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,360
You want a good girl,

192
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,430
but you need the bad pussy.

193
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,670
Whenever you're ready, my lord.

194
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,010
Try not to lose it this time.

195
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,880
I'll never take it off again.

196
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,040
I know you didn't want to leave Dorne,

197
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,960
but I'm glad you're coming home.

198
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,490
Your mother's desperate to see you.

199
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,480
I'm glad Trystane is coming with us.

200
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,030
He seems like a nice boy.

201
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,240
You're lucky.

202
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,710
Arranged marriages are rarely so--

203
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,550
so well arranged.

204
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,300
Do you think mother will like him?

205
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,210
If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will.

206
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,920
You really believe that?

207
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,470
Have you ever known your mother to like anyone

208
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,170
aside from her children?

209
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,640
She likes you.

210
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,930
I'm not so sure about that.

211
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,750
Listen...

212
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,150
There's something I wanted to tell you.

213
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,830
Something I should have told you long ago.

214
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,150
So...

215
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,000
Now that you've seen more of the world,

216
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,470
you've learned how complicated things can be,

217
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,020
people can be.

218
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,910
The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years,

219
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,100
but you've fallen in love with Trystane.

220
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,750
It was an accident, really. I mean, what were the chances?

221
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,540
You happen to fall in love with the man

222
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,730
you were assigned to marry?

223
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,470
My point is...

224
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,080
We don't choose whom we love.

225
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,090
It just, well--

226
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,620
It's beyond our control.

227
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,600
- I sound like an idiot. - No, you don't.

228
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,200
What I'm trying to say-- what I'm trying

229
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,510
and failing to say--

230
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,850
I know what you're trying to say.

231
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,970
No, I'm afraid you don't.

232
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,900
I do.

233
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,480
I know.

234
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,520
About you and mother.

235
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,200
I think a part of me always knew.

236
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,150
And I'm glad.

237
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,480
I'm glad that you're my father.

238
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,780
Myrcella?

239
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,610
Myrcella?

240
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,330
Myrcella? Myrcella?

241
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,440
You love her, don't you?

242
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,120
How could you not?

243
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,480
Of course it's hopeless for the both of you.

244
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,650
A sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight.

245
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,280
Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen.

246
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:32,850
But we always want the wrong woman.

247
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,390
Does he always talk so much?

248
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,890
Jorah the Andal.

249
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,800
Torgo Nudho.

250
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,320
He should not be here.

251
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,830
No, but he is.

252
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,380
Our queen ordered him exiled from city.

253
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,880
Our queen would be dead if not for him.

254
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,990
Punila. Thank you.

255
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,910
I am sorry.

256
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,670
Sorry I not there to fight for our queen.

257
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,960
You missed a good scrap.

258
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,190
None of that matters now.

259
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,010
The longer we sit here bantering,

260
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,570
the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.

261
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,950
He's right. The dragon headed north.

262
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,890
If we're going to find her, that's where we'll have to go.

263
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,020
We?

264
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,050
You're a Lannister.

265
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,790
The queen intends to remove your family from power.

266
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,630
And I intend to help her do it.

267
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,710
You've been here for how many days now?

268
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,770
I've fought for her for years.

269
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,750
Since she was little more than a child.

270
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,640
- You betrayed her. - Careful now.

271
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,220
And she exiled you. Twice, I believe.

272
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,750
The second time thanks to you.

273
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,310
Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont.

274
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,140
He's right. Our queen exiled Jorah.

275
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,490
And he's right. Jorah saved her life.

276
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,100
Perhaps she feels differently about him now.

277
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,280
Perhaps not. The only way we'll know is if we ask her.

278
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:09,150
Fine, fine. I suppose he can join us.

279
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,990
Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.

280
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,010
If I ever kill you, your eyes will be wide open.

281
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:17,910
Forgive me, but why would we bring you?

282
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,840
- Pardon me? - Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?

283
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,760
Not precisely, but I have other skills that would be useful.

284
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,980
Can you fight?

285
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,110
I have fought.

286
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,100
I don't claim to be a great warrior.

287
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,720
Are you good on a horse?

288
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,400
Middling.

289
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,090
So mainly you talk.

290
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,140
And drink. I've survived so far.

291
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,380
Which I respect, but you would not help us on this expedition.

292
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,350
You would help us here in Meereen, though.

293
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,340
None of us have experience governing a city

294
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,510
except for him.

295
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,360
You want to prove your value to the queen?

296
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,880
Prove it right here in Meereen.

297
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,560
He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language.

298
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,100
Why would the Meereenese listen to him?

299
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,270
They wouldn't.

300
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,890
They will listen to Grey Worm.

301
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,190
I'll come with you.

302
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,180
I'll find our queen.

303
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,100
- You are not strong enough to go anywhere. - I am.

304
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,810
He is. He's the toughest man with no balls I ever met.

305
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,650
But you still can't go.

306
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,000
The people believe in you.

307
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,010
They know you speak for the queen.

308
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:19,040
It's true.

309
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,530
Only the unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen.

310
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,300
If you leave,

311
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,650
half this city will consume the other half.

312
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,270
And Missandei.

313
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,710
Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei.

314
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,620
Certainly not me.

315
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,690
The queen's closest confidante,

316
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,360
the commander of the unsullied,

317
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:40,170
and a foreign dwarf with a scarred face.

318
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,010
Good fortune, my friends.

319
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:45,270
Meereen is ancient and glorious.

320
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,250
Try not to ruin her.

321
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,650
Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal.

322
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,330
Let's find some good horses.

323
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,050
We have so much to talk about.

324
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,840
Hello, old friend.

325
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,190
I thought we were so happy together

326
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,490
until you abandoned me.

327
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:40,140
I suppose there's no point asking how you found me.

328
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,750
The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east,

329
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,550
if one knows how to listen.

330
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:49,430
They tell me you've already found favor with the mother of dragons.

331
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,510
Well, she didn't execute me,

332
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,730
so that's a promising start.

333
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:58,200
Now the heroes are off to find her

334
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,080
and I'm stuck here

335
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,620
trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war.

336
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,700
Any advice for an old comrade?

337
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,160
Information is the key.

338
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,030
You need to learn your enemy's strengths and strategies.

339
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:13,180
You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.

340
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:17,830
If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.

341
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,340
If only.

342
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,280
A grand old city

343
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,300
choking on violence, corruption, and deceit.

344
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:30,180
Who could possibly have any experience

345
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,260
managing such a massive, ungainly beast?

346
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,890
I did miss you.

347
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,670
Oh, I know.

348
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,250
We have to go home.

349
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,310
Oh, my poor, sweet thing.

350
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:18,960
Does it hurt?

351
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,590
We have to go home.

352
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,430
Drogon.

353
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,360
Can you take me back to Meereen?

354
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,730
How far did you carry me?

355
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,670
Drogon, we need to return.

356
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,550
My people need me.

357
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,250
Well, there's no food.

358
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,220
At the very least, you could hunt us some supper.

359
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,400
Confess.

360
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,780
Confess.

361
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,930
I have sinned.

362
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,020
I see that now.

363
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,980
How can I have been so blind for so long?

364
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,750
I want to be clean again.

365
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,280
I want absolution.

366
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,940
The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high.

367
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,040
And by its holy light--

368
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,870
You wish to make a confession?

369
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,430
Once I've confessed, will I be free?

370
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,400
Your grace will be dealt with according to her sins.

371
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,550
The Mother have mercy, then.

372
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:07,680
I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage. I confess.

373
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,850
Name him.

374
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,810
Lancel Lannister.

375
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:18,030
Your cousin and the king's squire.

376
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,670
- I was lonely and afraid. - You had a husband.

377
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,630
A husband off whoring every chance he--

378
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:25,050
His sins do not pardon your own.

379
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,540
May the gods forgive me.

380
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,190
Other men?

381
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,100
No.

382
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:37,990
No others?

383
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,030
No.

384
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,990
Speaking falsehoods before the gods is a great crime.

385
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,930
You understand this?

386
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,040
I do.

387
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,450
There are those that say your children

388
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,720
were not fathered by King Robert,

389
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:59,160
that they are bastards born of incest and adultery.

390
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,360
A lie.

391
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,060
A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon.

392
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,100
He wants the throne,

393
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,040
but his brother's children stand in his way.

394
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,270
So he claims they are not his brother's.

395
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,610
That filth.

396
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,890
There is not one shred of truth to it.

397
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,260
I deny it.

398
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:19,810
Good.

399
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,280
But these are terrible charges.

400
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,360
And the realm must know the truth of them.

401
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,330
If Your Grace has given honest testimony,

402
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,500
your trial will prove your innocence.

403
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,040
Trial? I have confessed.

404
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,380
To a single sin.

405
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,680
Others you have denied.

406
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:42,450
Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.

407
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:47,680
I bow to the wisdom of your high holiness.

408
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,420
But if I might beg

409
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,830
for just one drop of the Mother's Mercy.

410
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:59,080
I haven't seen my son--

411
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,010
I don't know how long it's been.

412
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:04,760
I need to see him, please.

413
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:08,530
You have taken the first step on the path back to righteousness.

414
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:11,790
In light of this,

415
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,390
I will permit you to return to the Red Keep.

416
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:18,670
Thank you.

417
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:20,690
Thank you.

418
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,700
The Mother is merciful.

419
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,220
It is her you should thank.

420
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,850
I will. I will.

421
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:29,410
I swear it, day and night.

422
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:32,520
Good.

423
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,810
Am I free to go?

424
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:41,220
After your atonement.

425
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:45,400
My atonement?

426
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:02,690
A sinner comes before you.

427
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,960
Cersei of House Lannister.

428
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,470
Mother to His Grace King Tommen.

429
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:13,100
Widow of His Grace King Robert.

430
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:19,240
She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication.

431
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,800
She has confessed her sins

432
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,730
and begged for forgiveness.

433
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:27,270
To demonstrate her repentance,

434
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:31,490
she will cast aside all pride, all artifice,

435
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,740
and present herself as the gods made her

436
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:36,230
to you,

437
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,530
The good people of the city.

438
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,810
She comes before you with a solemn heart,

439
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,880
shorn of secrets,

440
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:50,180
naked before the eyes of gods and men...

441
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,710
to make her walk of atonement.

442
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,170
Shame. Shame.

443
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,160
Shame.

444
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:23,360
Shame.

445
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,600
Shame. Shame.

446
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:30,880
Shame.

447
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:34,730
Shame. Shame.

448
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,730
Shame.

449
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:42,530
Shame. Shame.

450
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:47,730
shame. Shame.

451
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,960
Shame.

452
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,580
Shame.

453
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,070
Shame. Shame.

454
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,710
Shame. Shame.

455
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,040
Shame.

456
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,680
Shame.

457
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:07,810
- Cunt! - Shame.

458
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:08,990
Whore!

459
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:10,910
- Shame. - Whore!

460
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:11,880
Shame.

461
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,010
- Whore! - Whore!

462
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:14,700
Shame.

463
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:18,710
Shame.

464
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,370
Shame.

465
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,050
- Whore! - Sinner!

466
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:26,440
- Shame. - Bitch! Brother fucker!

467
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,130
- Whore! - Shame.

468
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,920
- Fuck off! - Shame.

469
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,070
Shame.

470
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,640
All hail the royal tits. You're a bitch!

471
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,540
Shame.

472
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,230
- Get her! - Whore!

473
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,690
- Bitch! - Fucker!

474
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,470
- Fucker! - You bitch!

475
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:43,940
- Shame. - Cunt!

476
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:44,850
Shame.

477
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:48,200
Shame. Shame.

478
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:49,900
- Brother fucker! - Bitch!

479
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:54,140
I've had half as many cocks as the queen.

480
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:55,480
- Bitch! - Shame.

481
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,700
- Shame. - Sinner! - Whore! - Slut!

482
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:02,700
shame.

483
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:06,720
Shame. Shame.

484
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:09,690
Whore! Whore, whore.

485
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:12,400
I'm a Lannister. Suck me off!

486
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,370
- Suck me off, you bitch! - Back!

487
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:15,490
- Whore! - Shame.

488
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:17,890
shame.

489
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:21,550
Whore!

490
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:25,150
Whore! Whore! Whore!

491
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,130
shame. Shame.

492
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,470
Shame.

493
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:34,770
shame.

494
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:36,830
Shame.

495
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,070
Shame.

496
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,710
- Bitch! Bitch! - Shame.

497
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,960
Brother fucker!

498
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:56,880
Shame. Shame.

499
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:59,150
shame.

500
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,450
- Whore! - Brother fucker!

501
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:03,480
- Whore! - Shame.

502
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,220
Shame. Shame.

503
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:11,880
shame.

504
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:13,350
Shame.

505
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:15,450
Shame.

506
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:18,130
shame.

507
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,410
shame.

508
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:28,930
- Shame. - Fucker!

509
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,290
Shame. Shame.

510
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,410
shame.

511
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,700
Shame. Shame.

512
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:44,740
shame. Shame.

513
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,700
Shame.

514
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:50,530
Shame. Shame.

515
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:55,230
Shame. Shame.

516
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:56,950
Shame.

517
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:01,900
Shame. Shame.

518
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,370
Shame.

519
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:11,760
Shame. Shame.

520
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:15,370
Shame. Shame.

521
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:18,790
Shame.

522
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:58,870
Your grace.

523
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:07,340
It's good to have you back.

524
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,060
Come.

525
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,410
We'll take you inside.

526
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,270
I need to have a look at those feet.

527
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,820
May I have the honor of

528
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:25,340
presenting the newest member of the kingsguard?

529
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:44,550
If it please your grace, he has taken a holy vow of silence.

530
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:47,070
He has sworn that he will not speak

531
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:49,630
until all his grace's enemies are dead

532
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,820
and evil has been driven from the realm.

533
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:02,120
Who came to your aid? Stannis.

534
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,110
Now he needs you.

535
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,940
We don't have enough men to make any difference.

536
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,550
The wildlings will make a difference.

537
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:08,150
The wildlings will never fight for Stannis.

538
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:11,210
- I told him before. - You saved their bloody lives.

539
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,750
If they're gonna live in the Seven Kingdoms,

540
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:17,310
safe behind our Wall, they ought to fight for the damn place.

541
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:19,650
- It's not their fight. - Open the gates!

542
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:40,780
Stannis?

543
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,000
Shireen? The princess?

544
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:45,910
Lord Commander.

545
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:48,210
It's one of the wildlings you brought back.

546
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:49,780
Says he knows your uncle Benjen.

547
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:51,450
Says he's still alive.

548
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,490
Are you sure he's talking about Benjen?

549
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:57,070
Said he was first ranger.

550
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,960
Said he knows where to find him.

551
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:11,310
Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome at the last full moon.

552
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,620
- Could be lying. - Could be.

553
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:14,960
There are ways to find out.

554
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,810
- Where is he? - Over there.

555
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,660
For the watch.

556
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,750
For the watch.

557
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:46,060
For the watch.

558
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:49,930
For the watch.

559
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:53,090
for the watch.

560
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,770
Olly...

561
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:48,070
For the watch.
