蕩婦
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}'Sluts!'

86
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,900

{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Yes?

87
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,980
今天我會死在這兒的 我們都會被姦殺的
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I'm going to die here. We're going to be raped and die.

88
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,380
每一片雲
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Every cloud...

89
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,630

{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Oh, just open the fucking door. It's been fucking forev...

93
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,180

{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Really beautiful grounds. - Extraordinary energy, yeah.

94

有人請你們兩位來我們這裏做冥想 你們倆真幸運
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I see you've been gifted this retreat. How lucky you both are.

95
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,020
我希望這個週末之後 你們會感到靈魂得以安放 精神受到鼓舞
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I hope after this weekend, you will feel rested, inspired.

96
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,620
-你們這裏有無線網嗎 -沒有
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Do you have Wi-Fi? - No.

97
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,560
呃 你們是要兩張單人床還是一張雙人床
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Erm, would you like two single beds or a double?

98
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,300
-兩個單人床 -一個雙人床謝謝
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Two singles. - A double, please.

99
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,140
-事實上 你有沒有分開來的房間 -恐怕沒有
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Actually, do you have a separate room? - I'm afraid not.

100
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,150
在這裏每個人都要和別人同住 這是共同生活的一部分
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Everyone has to share here. It's part of the communal...

101
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,660
那就單人床吧 你們早上有報紙嗎
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Singles, then. Do you get newspapers in the morning?

102
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,140
不 我們試著在你們住宿期間
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}No, we try to keep the outside world on the outside

103
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,820
將外界信息隔絕在外
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}during your stay here.

104
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,180
我承諾 你們最終會感激這點的
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}You'll appreciate it in the end, I promise.

105
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,820
-好 這是你們的鑰匙 -謝謝
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- So, here is your key. - Thank you.

106
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,980
-祝你們度過一個放鬆的週末 -你也是
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- You have a restful weekend. - You too.

107
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,660
-哇哦 沒有報紙 -你又不讀報
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Wow, no papers. - You don't read the news.

108
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,820
-不 我讀 -昨天發生了什麼事
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Yes, I do! - What happened yesterday?

109
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,430
黏糊糊的舊白牛仔褲和一隻小狗卡在了風扇裏
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Sting wore white jeans and a puppy got stuck in a fan.

110
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,710
真是個大日子
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Big day.

111
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,790
-那個是幹什麼的 -塗我的脖子和胸
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- What's that for? - My neck and chest.

112
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,010
-那個是幹什麼的 -塗我的腿和膝蓋
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- What's that for? - My legs and knees.

113
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,980
-那個是幹什麼的 -塗我的發尾
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- What's that for? - Ends of my hair.

114
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,620
-那是幹什麼的 -塗我的眼袋
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- What's that? - For my under-eyes.

115
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,380
-那是幹什麼的 -塗我的臉和全身
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- What's that? - That is for my face and body.

116
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,390
如果有個人把這些都偷走了 你會怎麼辦
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}What would you do if someone stole all of those?

117
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,060
我會自殺
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I'd kill myself.

118
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,540
為什麼這裏沒有插座
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Why are there no plug sockets in here?

119
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,260
別碰我的東西
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Don't touch my stuff.

120
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,980
-這些是幹什麼的 -沒什麼
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- What are these for? - Nothing.

121
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,020
-嗯 -怎麼了
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Mm-hm. - What?

122
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,020
沒什麼 只是
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Well, it's just...

123
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,750
你為什麼要帶這麼小的電池
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Why would you bring such tiny batteries?

124
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,740
我只是準備得充分而已
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I'm just prepared.

125
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,940
只是我曾經
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Just I've only ever...

126
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,560
-看見遙控器裏用過 -對
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- seen them used for remote controls. - Yes.

127
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,990
-或者鬧鐘里 -對
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Or alarm clocks. - Yes, all right.

128
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,440
-或者震動棒 -對 就是這個
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- And vibrators. - Yes! All right!

129
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,790
你根本不用申請分開的房間
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}You didn't have to ask for a separate room!

130
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,820
什麼
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}What?

131
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,890
如果你想自慰 我可以給你空間的
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}If you want to have a wank, I can give you some space.

132
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,940
哦 我的天哪
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Oh, my God!

133
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,720
不是的 如果你需要花十分鐘
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}No, if you want to take ten minutes,

134
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,870
我會去浴室給我的手腕擦點霜
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I'll go into the bathroom and moisturise my wrists for a bit.

135
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,660
-你真幼稚 -我還沒完呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- You are so immature! - Oh, give it a minute.

136
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,740
哦 天哪 嚴肅點
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Oh, God. Seriously!

137
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,660
你腦子有什麼問題
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- What is wrong with your insides?

138
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,860
你為什麼要帶這些小電池
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Why did you bring the tiny batteries?

139
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,820


140
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,700
你這個天才
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}You're a genius.

141
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,220
總能發現備用品在哪裏
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Always know where the reserves are.

142
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,860
放下你的過去
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Let go of your past.

143
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,020
-說到點子上了 -現在是時候放下了
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Bit on the nose. - Now is the time to let it go.

144
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,810
開放你的感官 閉上嘴 享受現在
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Open up your senses, close your mouth and live now.

145
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:00,820
歡迎來到只對女性開放的寂靜之息冥想活動
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Welcome to the female-only Breath Of Silence retreat.

146
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,540
女性們應該沉默
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Women don't speak.

147
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,380
呃 對不起 我覺得我應該在
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Erm, sorry. I think I'm meant to be at...

148
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,480
-「可恨的蕩婦」 -那個活動
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- 'Fucking sluts!' - ...that one.

149
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,020
可惜了
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Shame.

150
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:19,630
是的 現在最重要的問題是你們為什麼在這裏
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Yes, the first major consideration is why are you here?

151
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,620
現場誰能回答這個問題
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Can anyone here answer that question?

152
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,540
我想隔絕外面的噪音 重新回到我的內心
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I want to shut the noise out and reconnect to my inner thoughts

153
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,180
去獲取更多關於自身的感覺
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}on the road to feeling more at one with myself.

154
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,580
不錯的態度
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Excellent attitude.

155
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,220
那麼 你來對了地方
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Well, you're in the right place.

156
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,700
這個週末有關於專注內心
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}And this weekend is about being mindful.

157
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,300
關於將你的聲音留在頭腦裏
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}It's about leaving your voice in your head...

158
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,860
將你的想法困在頭顱中
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}...and trapping your thoughts in your skull.

159
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,730
想像你的大腦中有一個思維監獄
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Think of it as a thought prison in your mind.

160
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,710
首先 我們將會教你如何呼吸
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Firstly, we're going to teach you how to breathe.

161
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,620
接著我們會有一次短暫的冥想
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Then we will have a short meditation,

162
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,340
然後我們會在參加枯燥任務的過程中尋找到我們心靈的庇護所
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}then we will find our sanctuary in the partaking of menial tasks,

163
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,310
這一切都在絕對的寂靜中
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}all in perfect silence.

164
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,900
原則性的規定就是不要講話
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Principal rules are no talking.

165
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,700
如果你想和我們其中一位監管員交流
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}If you need to communicate with any of our other superiors,

166
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,140
你可以寫在那個黑板上
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}you can write on that board.

167
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,940
在任何你想交流的情況下
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Under no other circumstances must you communicate,

168
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,340
甚至是想互相交流的時候
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}even with each other.

169
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,500
-如果是緊急情況呢 -感謝你們今天到場
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- What about an emergency? - Thank you all for coming here today.

170
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,790
不管發生了什麼 一點聲音都不能發出
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}No matter what happens, a word must not be heard.

171
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,980
噓
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Shh!

172
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,460
「蕩婦」
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}'Slut!'

173
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,060
「蕩婦」
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}'Slut!'

174
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,740
「賤人」
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}'Bitch!'

175
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,420
「賤人 賤人」
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}'Bitch, bitch!'

176
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,540
可恨的賤人 你就是一坨屎
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Fucking bitch! You fucking piece of shit.

177
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,700
過來 過來 到我這兒來
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Back here! Back here, back to me. Back to me.

178
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,540
好的 現在 不管那些怨言是因為什麼 是因為你的教養也好
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}All right, now, wherever it's come from... your upbringing,

179
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:02,140
或是因為你和女人的經歷也罷 現在是時候改變一下了
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}your experiences with women, now is the time to turn that around.

180
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,220
重裝你的思想
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}To reprogram your mind,

181
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,940
你的身體 你的嘴
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}your body and your mouth.

182
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,500
成為一個更好的男人
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}To be the better... man.

183
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,860
好嗎
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}All right?

184
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,740
那麼 這位是帕特希亞
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}So, this... is Patricia.

185
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,300
好嗎 她是個朋友
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Yeah? She's a friend.

186
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,180
現在 帕特希亞剛剛在工作中獲得升職
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Now, Patricia has just earned a promotion at work,

187
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,740
打敗了其他六位候選者
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}beating over six other candidates.

188
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,270
她是獲得這個這個職位最年輕的人
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}She's the youngest person to ever achieve this role.

189
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,060
我們在遇見她的時候不能說什麼
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}What should we not say when we meet her?

190
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,320
-聰明的小不點 -好極了
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Clever little munchkin? - Excellent.

191
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,440
-你為誰口交才得到的這個職位 -好
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Who did you blow to get that job? - OK.

192
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,870

193
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,710
好的
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Ok.

194
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,580
我們應當對她說什麼呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}What should we say to her?

195
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,900
嗯
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Hmm?

196
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,260

{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Well done, Patricia. - Very good.

197
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,620
「做的不錯 帕特希亞」
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}"Well done, Patricia."

198
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,860
請離開
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Please leave.

199
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,040

{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Perv. - Slut.

201
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,940
做的不錯 帕特希亞
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Well done, Patricia.

202
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,820
蕩婦
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Slut!

203
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,940
夥計們 沒事
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Guys, it's OK.

204
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,260
凱斯 來
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Keith, come.

205
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,220
我的天哪 對不起女士 你不能來這裏
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Oh, my God. Excuse me, miss, you can't be here.

206
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,820
-好的 -你真的不能到這裏來
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- OK. - You really can't be here.

207
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,580
這會讓他們感覺不好的 求你了
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}It's a feel-no-good. Please.

208
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,340
現在 舉起你們的手
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}And now, hands up.

209
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,550
掌心相對
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Mirror your palms.

210
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,540
看著對方的眼睛
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Look each other in the eye, and...

211
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,250
然後觸碰
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}...touch.

212
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,040
絕對是她最可怕的噩夢
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Literally her worst nightmare.

213
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,100
噁
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Eugh!

214
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,340
你還好嗎
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Are you all right?

215
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,980
-和我說說 -沒什麼
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Talk to me. - It's nothing.

216
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,060
天哪
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}God.

217
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,580
我感覺不到我的腳了
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I can't feel my feet.

218
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,500
你還記得我們曾經玩「從頭到腳」嗎
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Do you remember we used to go top-to-toe?

219
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,600
現在的孩子都很怪
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Now kids are so weird.

220
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,120
-我們以前總是玩那個遊戲
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- We used to do that all the time.

221
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,620
-對呀 我們那時才十歲 也很可愛
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Yeah, when we were ten and cute.

222
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,580
-現在我們三十歲了 而且憤世嫉俗 -我不是在說我們
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Now we're 30 and angry. - I'm not suggesting that we...

223
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,960
就是別說了 行嗎
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Just don't, OK?

224
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,960
別偷我的東西了
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Stop stealing my things!

225
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,740
我只是試試它好不好使
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I'm just checking it's working.

226
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,940
哦 它絕對好使
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Oh, it's working, it's definitely working.

227
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,760
噓
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}'Shh!'

228
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,180
玩的開心
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Have fun.

229
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,620
這真是個十分體貼的禮物 謝謝你
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}It's actually a really thoughtful present. Thank you.

230
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,580
馬丁給我了那個小雕塑
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}And Martin getting me that sculpture.

231
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,420
他為了買到這個東西肯定花了不少心血
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}He must have bent over backwards to get something like that.

232
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,100
我覺得自己好幸運
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I feel very lucky.

233
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,460
我跟你說啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I have to tell you something.

234
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,140
什麼
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}What?

235
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:25,260
那個雕像是我從別人的工作室順手拿的
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I stole that sculpture from a certain somebody's studio

236
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,300
然後想通過馬丁找個買主
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}and then I tried to sell it through Martin,

237
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,080
不過馬丁把雕像留下了 還送給了你
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}but Martin took it and gave it to you.

238
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,970
這事你可別當著老爸
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Just don't put it pride of place when Dad...

239
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,010
呃 當著他們的面說
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}well, when they come over.

240
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,440
-好嗎 因為 -好
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- OK? Because... - Right.

241
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,380
克萊爾
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Claire!

242
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,260
-克萊爾 -噓 快睡吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Claire! - Shh. Go to sleep.

243
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,820
該死
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Shit.

244
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,220
-我們越快適應 -啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- The sooner we get on... - Ah.

245
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,580
我們越快適應 就能越快離開這裏
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}The sooner we get on with it, the sooner we are out of here.

246
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,970
-這外套真好看 -謝啦
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- That's a really nice outfit. - Thanks.

247
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,260
深入挖掘你的回憶
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Delve into your past.

248
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,850
想想你無法釋懷的東西
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Think of something you can't let go of.

249
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,850
一段噪音
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}A moment of noise.

250
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,980
一個緊張時刻
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}A moment of tension.

251
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,690
-不要 -現在
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Not for now. - Now...

252
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,210
想想你覺得內心平靜的時刻
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}...A moment when you were peaceful.

253
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,750
要是你能隨心所欲
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}If you could change

254
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,580
改變世上的任何東西 你想改變什麼
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}anything in the whole world, what would it be?

255
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,200
我的大腿
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}My thighs.

256
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,660
整個世界你就想改變這個
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}In the whole world?

257
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,780
可別跟別人說 那你呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Don't tell anyone I said that. You?

258
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,240
我一直對自己的顏值挺不滿的
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I've always been insecure about my face.

259
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,060
-你明明知道 -我知道
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- You know that. - I know.

260
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,700
-你不用不滿啊 -謝了 不過
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- You shouldn't. - Thank you, but...

261
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,500
不啊 真的 你的鼻子一點問題都沒有
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}No, seriously, there's nothing wrong with your nose.

262
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,110
-我的意思是 你的臉 -你再說一遍
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- I mean, there's nothing wrong... - Say that again?

263
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,460
-我的意思是 你的臉 -你說什麼
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- I mean, there's nothing wrong... - What?

264
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,810
不知道
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I don't know.

265
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,070
-啊 -哦天
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Ah! - Oh, my God.

266
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,040
我總說錯話
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I always say the wrong thing!

267
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,140
啊 啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Ah! Agh!

268
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,380
好燙
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Hot.

269
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,420
這是幹嘛 我在自己家都不幹這些活的
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}What is this? I don't even do this in my own home.

270
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,100
道理很簡單
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Well, it's very simple.

271
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,950
我們是花錢給人家做掃除 還不能出聲
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}We've paid them to let us clean their house in silence.

272
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,100
老天
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Jesus.

273
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,460
我不想像老師一樣批評你們
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I don't want to come down on you like a schoolteacher,

274
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,140
但是你們明目張膽違反這裏的規則
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}but I'm afraid your flagrant lack of respect for the one rule

275
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,500
恐怕已經影響到其他學生了
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}that we have here is now affecting the other students.

276
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,200
-顧客 -你是說囚犯嗎
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Clients. - Inmates?

277
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,220
-或者說是清潔工吧 -參與者
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Cleaners? - Participants!

278
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,180
你們對這個活動有什麼不滿嗎
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Do you have a problem with the programme?

279
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,020
我建議你們在這裏靜坐一小時
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I suggest you try sitting here in silence for the next hour.

280
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,310
對你們有好處的
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}It will benefit you.

281
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,540
我以靈魂發誓 肯定有好處
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I swear by my soul, it will.

282
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,980
我翻你的包來著
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I went through your bag.

283
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,770
什麼
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}What?

284
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,300
我什麼也沒找到 所以你得
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I couldn't find anything, so you're just going to have

285
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,190
親自告訴我你到底怎麼了
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}to tell me what's going on with you.

286
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,100
說話 不然我就喊啦
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Talk! Or I will scream.

287
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,900
我獲得了升職到芬蘭的機會
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I got the Finland promotion.

288
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,200
什麼升職到芬蘭
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}What Finland promotion?

289
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,320
你怎麼還問 我都跟你說過了
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}How can you ask that? I've told you about it!

290
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,240
我知道 挺好的呀
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I know the Finland promotion, that's amazing.

291
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,370
謝謝
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Thank you.

292
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,620
這是不是就意味著你現在是土豪啦 抱大腿
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Does that mean you're a millionaire now? Handy.

293
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,060
別傻了
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Don't be ridiculous.

294
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,380
是啊 會是
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Yes, it would.

295
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,220
所以你有錢還不開心嗎
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}All that money makes you cry?

296
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,100
我準備拒絕掉
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I'm turning it down.

297
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,980
什麼
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}What?

298
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,860
為什麼 因為馬丁唄
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Why? Martin?

299
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,000
馬丁說這樣對傑克不公平
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Martin says it would be unfair on Jake.

300
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,140
傑克是她的繼子 他真是個怪胎
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Jake's her stepson, he's really weird,

301
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,780
從癥狀來看是這樣 但是沒人這麼說
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}probably clinically, but no-one really talks about that.

302
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,300
要是她有超過一天不在身邊 他就嚇尿了
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}He freaks out if she's gone for longer than a day

303
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,340
他甚至想跟她一起洗澡
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}and he's got this thing about trying to get in the bath with her.

304
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,860
不 不 不 傑克 不行
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}No, no. No, Jake. No!

305
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,330
他都十五歲了
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}He's 15.

306
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,290
-他又不是你兒子 -重點不在這
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- He's not your son. - That's not the point.

307
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,680
-去吧 -我就知道你會這麼說
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Go! - I knew you'd say that.

308
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,260
-你不是一直想要這個機會嗎 -我知道
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- This is what you've always wanted. - I know.

309
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,930
-再也不用穿職業裝 還到處都是雪 -我知道
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- No more power suits, fuckload of snow. - I know.

310
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,870
那地方很適合你這種冷血動物啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Perfect place for your cold, cold heart.

311
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,650
我知道 但我做不到
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I know, I can't!

312
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,330
-我有我的責任 -噢 別鬧了
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- I have responsibilities. - Oh, come on.

313
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,060
別讓別人妨礙你追求理想
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Don't let other people get in the way of what you really want.

314
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,660
芬蘭就是你的理想
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Finland is what you really want.

315
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,580
我丈夫可不是什麼「別人」 好嗎
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}My husband isn't "Other people", OK?

316
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,540
我丈夫就是我的生活支柱
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}My husband is my life.

317
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,960
你丈夫在你生日那天還想親我來著
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Your husband tried to kiss me on your birthday.

318
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,260
真的嗎
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Did he?

319
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,540
真的嗎
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Did he?

320
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,620
蕩婦

322
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,300
蕩婦
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Slut!

323
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,730
-蕩婦 -不錯 不錯
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Slut! - Lovely, lovely.

324
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,320
好了嗎
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Ok?

325
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,100
站起來 我們要說「對不起 帕特希亞」
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Up on your feet. We're going to say, "Sorry, Patricia."

326
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,460
對不起 帕特希亞
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Sorry, Patricia.

327
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,420
很好 給自己鼓鼓掌吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Lovely, give yourselves a round of applause.

328
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,820
好了 各位 做得很好
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}All right, guys. Well done.

329
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:10,680

{\3c&H000000&\fs35}We are going to head back to that house better men, yeah?

330
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,990

{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Well done, good work. Great stuff.

331
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,090
-對 嶄新的面貌 -很好
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}- Yeah, a new man. - Well done.

332
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,220
繼續
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Go on.

333
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,940
你可以的
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}You can do it.

334
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,340
加油
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}You're ready.

335
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,740
嗯 我覺得我認出你了
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Yeah, I... thought I recognised you.

336
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,820
好吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Fair enough.

337
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,860
這樣就好
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Probably for the best.

338
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,060
所以 你的生意
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}So, is your business...

339
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,260

{\3c&H000000&\fs35}...surviving?

340
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,420
對不起
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I'm sorry.

341
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,220
噢 我不想抽了
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}No, I don't want that.

342
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,810
所以 你是在
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}So, you're doing the whole...

343
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,500
沉默訓練營之類的
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}silent escape thing.

344
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,620
看來是的
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Indeed.

345
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,420
還好嗎
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Going well?

346
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,260
我摸了一個同事的胸
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I touched a colleague's breast.

347
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,960
不止一次
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}More than once.

348
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,350
在派對上 我
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}At a party, I...

349
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,500
他們讓我去參加訓練營
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}They asked me to go on a workshop to...

350
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,860
我就是個非常
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I'm just a very...

351
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,180
令人失望的人
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}...disappointing man.

352
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,140
不了 謝了 我正在戒呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}No, thanks, I'm trying to quit.

353
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,260
另一方面 那些人
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Those, on the other hand.

354
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,960
他們一直問我「你想從訓練營得到什麼」
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}They keep asking me, "What do you want from this workshop?

355
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,380
「你想要什麼」
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}"What do you want?"

356
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,740
我才不會告訴他們我想要什麼
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I'm not telling them what I want.

357
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,500
我想回家
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I want to move back home.

358
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,620
我想抱老婆
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I want to hug my wife.

359
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,180
保護孩子 保護女兒
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Protect my children, protect my daughter.

360
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,460
我想重新開始
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I want to move on.

361
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,140
我想道歉
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I want to apologise.

362
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,180
跟所有人道歉
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}To everyone.

363
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,500
想去電影院
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Want to go to the theatre.

364
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,940
我想把乾淨的杯子從洗碗機裏拿出來
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I want to take clean cups out of the dishwasher

365
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,260
放到我家的壁櫥裏
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}and put them in the cupboard at home...

366
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,720
第二天早上 我想看著我老婆用這些杯子喝水
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}...and the next morning, I want to watch my wife drink from them.

367
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,540
我想讓她開心
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}And I want to make her feel good.

368
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,020
我想讓她再次達到高潮
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I want to make her orgasm again.

369
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,900
一遍又一遍
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}And again.

370
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,020
真的
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Truly.

371
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,530
我只是想哭
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}I just want to cry.

372
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,080
一直都是
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}All the time.

373
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,760
克萊爾
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Claire?

374
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,060
你們看見我姐姐沒有
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Have you seen my sister?

375
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,250


376
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,320
你好 我是小波
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}'Hi, this is Boo.

377
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,870
現在無法接電話
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}'I can't come to the phone right now,

378
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,770
請留言
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}'but please leave me a messiagio,

379
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,200

380
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,970
要是有人把電話線拔了就好了
{\3c&H000000&\fs35}Someone should probably disconnect that.

381
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,220
