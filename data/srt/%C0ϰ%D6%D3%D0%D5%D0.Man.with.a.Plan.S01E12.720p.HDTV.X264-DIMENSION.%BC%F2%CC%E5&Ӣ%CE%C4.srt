匹兹堡最受欢迎的
伯恩斯兄弟工程公司

2
00:00:05,618 --> 00:00:07,448
看看谁从地板展览会上回来了
Look who's back from the flooring expo.

3
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:08,696
这次你又顺走了多少个
How many free burritos

4
00:00:08,721 --> 00:00:10,921
免费的墨西哥卷饼啊
did you sneak out with this time?

5
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:11,988
六个
Six.

6
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:14,226
一整天都得和你待在这个
I'm so happy I'll be sealed

7
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:16,819
密不透风的地方 我真是太开心了
inside this tin can with you all day.

8
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:20,135
我们的命运或许被我改写了
I think I might have just changed our lives.

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,099
我发现 比我更钟爱免费墨西哥卷饼的人
Turns out the only person who likes free burritos

10
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:25,001
只有丽莎·麦卡弗里了
more than me is Lisa McCaffrey.

11
00:00:25,003 --> 00:00:26,616
那个地产开发商吗
The property developer?

12
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:28,839
几年前我就想和她见面谈谈了
I've been trying to get a meeting with her for years.

13
00:00:28,841 --> 00:00:30,741
我在调料区和她聊了几句
Well, I chatted her up at the salsa bar,

14
00:00:30,743 --> 00:00:34,277
还在她往卷饼里加鳄梨酱的时候帮她端了碟子
and then I held her plate while she guac'ed her taco.

15
00:00:35,249 --> 00:00:36,413
你是不是在暗示我
Is that your way of telling me

16
00:00:36,415 --> 00:00:38,448
我要被她起诉了
I'm gonna get a call from her lawyer?

17
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,083
不会 我先发制人
No, I broke the ice.

18
00:00:40,085 --> 00:00:42,319
为我们赢得了他们新开发项目的投标机会
And I got us a chance to bid on their new development.

19
00:00:42,321 --> 00:00:43,820
五幢房子
Five houses.

20
00:00:43,822 --> 00:00:44,891
你说真的吗
Are you serious?

21
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,257
唐 我们从来没有做过这么大的项目
Don, we've never done a job that big before.

22
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:49,459
这可是一大笔收入啊
That could mean a lot of money coming in.

23
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:51,595
我们可以买更多设备 雇更多员工
We could buy more equipment, hire more crew.

24
00:00:51,597 --> 00:00:53,497
我觉得这次我们的赢面不小
I think we've got a real shot at this.

25
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:55,065
我使出了浑身解数
I gave her the full Don Burns.

26
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:58,235
她被我惊艳得头发飞舞 就跟拍MV似的
Her hair was blowing back like a girl in a music video.

27
00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:01,138
好了 所以
Okay, so

28
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,439
我们和丽莎面谈的时候
when we sit down with Lisa,

29
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:04,074
我会先亮出成功案例
I'll hit her with our glowing references,

30
00:01:04,076 --> 00:01:05,308
过一遍数据
run her through the numbers.

31
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,770
然后我施展魅力 最后 以一个笑话收尾
Then I turn on the charm, and, boom, close with a joke.

32
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,390
好
Okay.

33
00:01:08,413 --> 00:01:12,082
是不是要拿独腿芭蕾女舞者艾琳开玩笑
You gonna do the one about the one-legged ballerina names Eileen?

34
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:14,818
不 麦卡弗里是爱尔兰人
No. McCaffrey's Irish.

35
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,987
我要讲教皇卡在电话亭里的那个
I'm gonna go with the Pope stuck in the phone booth.

36
00:01:18,123 --> 00:01:20,357
这种社会舆论她会喜欢的
She'll enjoy the social commentary.

37
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:22,492
好的 然后你把我们的浮标钥匙链发给他们
Okay, then you hand out our floating key chains,

38
00:01:22,494 --> 00:01:23,827
这次尽量不要
and try not to give 'em the one

39
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:25,862
把挂着自己车钥匙的那个也给他们
with your car keys attached this time.

40
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:29,176
然后 就... 就好了
And then, boom, we... we're done.

41
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,378
推介准备得怎么样了
Hey, how's the pitch coming?

42
00:01:31,403 --> 00:01:32,836
看上去不错 我们完事儿
Looking good, yeah. We're all done.

43
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:35,082
要看比赛了
We're gonna watch the game.

44
00:01:35,107 --> 00:01:36,807
你觉得今晚请洛厄尔过来
how would you feel about inviting Lowell

45
00:01:36,809 --> 00:01:38,308
和你们一起看怎么样
to come watch with you tonight?

46
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,177
洛厄尔
Lowell?

47
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:42,412
来这里
Here?

48
00:01:44,183 --> 00:01:45,949
邀请他
On purpose?

49
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:48,552
我在学校里看够他了
I see enough of him at school.

50
00:01:48,554 --> 00:01:50,420
而且在昨天"带爸爸去上学"活动上
And he was in rare form yesterday

51
00:01:50,422 --> 00:01:52,355
他的表现跟他平时差远了
at "Bring Your Dad to School" day.

52
00:01:52,357 --> 00:01:54,925
作为一个建筑承包商 
So, as a contractor, I get to use

53
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:57,223
我能够使用很多很酷的工具
a lot of really cool tools,

54
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,163
比如这把激光测温枪
like this thermal laser,

55
00:02:00,165 --> 00:02:03,400
它可以告诉我任何东西的温度
which can tell me the temperature of anything.

56
00:02:03,402 --> 00:02:05,368
罗德里格兹老师是...
Mrs. Rodriguez is...

57
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:08,638
冷若冰霜 一如既往
ice-cold, as usual.

58
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,441
现在艾米会给每一个人发
Okay, now Emme is gonna hand out free

59
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:14,044
我们的免费浮标钥匙链
floating key chains to all of you.

60
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:18,335
谢谢你 伯恩斯先生 给孩子们发这些
Thank you, Mr. Burns, for giving the kids things

61
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,093
他们以后能用来砸我了 
they will throw at me later.

62
00:02:20,593 --> 00:02:21,493
洛厄尔 到你了
Lowell, you're up. 

63
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:22,873
谢谢 罗德里格兹老师
Thanks, Mrs. Rodriguez.

64
00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:24,788
我叫洛厄尔
My name is Lowell,

65
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,523
我是一个全职爸爸
and I am a stay-at-home dad,

66
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:27,958
也就是说 一周有四十个小时
which means 40 hours a week,

67
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,160
我都是一个人独处
I am entirely alone.

68
00:02:30,486 --> 00:02:33,163
这也使我发现了我的才能
And that's how I discovered my talent

69
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:37,667
就是把吐司啃出各个州的形状
for eating toast into the shapes of states.

70
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:40,203
所以我才觉得你应该邀请他
Well, that's why I think you should invite him.

71
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:42,239
今天我在杂货店看到他了
I saw him at the grocery store today,

72
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:44,209
一眼就看到他孤零零的
and he was obviously lonely.

73
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:47,744
他不是唐和我会找来一起玩的那种人
He's just not the kind of guy that Don and I hang out with.

74
00:02:47,746 --> 00:02:49,312
有那么糟糕吗
Well, I mean, is that such a bad thing?

75
00:02:49,314 --> 00:02:51,002
唐 你挺讨我喜欢的
I mean, Don, you know, I love you,

76
00:02:51,027 --> 00:02:53,867
但当你们俩在一起的时候 你有一半的话是以
but when you two are together, half your sentences end with,

77
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:55,691
"她也这么说"结尾
"That's what she said."

78
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:59,534
就算那个女生说不出这种话来
Even when there's no way that's what she could have said.

79
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:03,437
亲爱的 你可以试着不要插手吗
Honey, could you just try to keep your fingers out of it.

80
00:03:03,462 --> 00:03:06,496
她也这么说
That's what she said.

81
00:03:11,403 --> 00:03:13,436
我已经告诉洛厄尔他可以过来了
Yeah, well, I already told Lowell he could come over.

82
00:03:13,438 --> 00:03:14,537
他会在十分钟后到
He'll be here in ten minutes.

83
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:16,640
什么 所以你就背着我
What? So basically you just

84
00:03:16,642 --> 00:03:18,508
给我找了个玩伴
set me up on a playdate?

85
00:03:19,311 --> 00:03:21,678
男人可不是这么交朋友的
That is not how men make friends.

86
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,780
我是要让你长长见识
I am expanding your horizons.

87
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:25,181
我自己也这么做
I do it for myself, too,

88
00:03:25,183 --> 00:03:27,584
所以明天我约了艾丽西亚·罗德里格兹
which is why tomorrow I am going for drinks

89
00:03:27,586 --> 00:03:29,386
喝点东西
with Alicia Rodriguez.

90
00:03:29,388 --> 00:03:33,423
想不到你会对自己做出这种事
Wow, I can't believe you're doing that to yourself.

91
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:35,892
她也这么说
That's what she said.

92
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,699
我是个女人 我知道她说了什么
I am a woman. I know what she said.

93
00:03:53,654 --> 00:03:54,821
- 你们好啊 - 嗨
- Hey, guys. - Hey.

94
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:56,091
非常感谢你们邀请我
Thanks so much for having me.

95
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:57,844
安迪说你想请我过来看比赛
When Andi said you wanted me to come watch the game,

96
00:03:57,869 --> 00:03:59,559
把我高兴坏了
I was super jazzed.

97
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:03,568
同乐同乐
Well, the jazz is mutual.

98
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:05,599
但有件事 洛厄尔
But here's the thing, Lowell.

99
00:04:05,624 --> 00:04:08,291
企鹅队的比赛一开始 我们就不怎么讲话了
Once the Penguins game starts, we don't talk much.

100
00:04:08,293 --> 00:04:10,891
我从来不在比赛期间讲话... 兆头不好
Oh, I never talk during Pens games... bad luck.

101
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,528
得在开球前
Gotta unpack these snacks

102
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:13,830
把零食都拿出来
before the puck drops.

103
00:04:13,832 --> 00:04:16,248
首先 七层蘸酱
First up, seven-layer dip.

104
00:04:16,273 --> 00:04:19,307
先告诉你们 最底下一层是玉米片哟
Spoiler alert, the bottom layer is Doritos.

105
00:04:20,813 --> 00:04:22,678
你说什么
What did you just say?

106
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:24,229
他说 玉米片蘸酱 
He said Dorito dip. 

107
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:25,223
就是说 你可以用更多的玉米片
That's dip with Doritos

108
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:28,793
蘸这个含有玉米片的蘸酱
in it that you can dip into with more Doritos?

109
00:04:29,763 --> 00:04:31,347
这是你发明的
You invented this?

110
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:34,399
我这辈子可算等到你了
I've been waiting for you my whole life.

111
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:36,851
怎么样了 三位
How's it going, fellas?

112
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,403
不许说话 比赛要开始了
No talking. The game's starting.

113
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:40,138
抱歉
Sorry.

114
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,122
我也等了你一辈子了
I've been waiting for you my whole life.

115
00:04:47,758 --> 00:04:49,351
这是中场休息点心
Here's an intermission treat.

116
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:50,970
新鲜出炉的爆米花
Fresh popcorn with Junior Mints

117
00:04:50,995 --> 00:04:52,528
搀薄荷糖
already mixed in.

118
00:04:52,842 --> 00:04:54,118
不是吧
Shut up!

119
00:04:55,956 --> 00:04:57,589
唐 我刚收到了一封邮件
Hey, Don, I just got an e-mail

120
00:04:57,591 --> 00:04:59,324
丽莎·麦卡弗里的人发的
from Lisa McCaffrey's people.

121
00:04:59,326 --> 00:05:01,926
他们问我们做展示有何设备需求
They want to know our tech needs for the presentation.

122
00:05:02,572 --> 00:05:04,662
准备一桶水放钥匙链就行啦
A bucket of water for the key chain would help.

123
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:07,770
能让他们看到钥匙链浮起来
They could see it float.

124
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:10,235
这算个点子
Okay, that's an idea.

125
00:05:10,785 --> 00:05:13,073
但他们的设备需求应该不是这个意思
But I don't think that's what they meant by "tech" needs.

126
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:15,548
他们只是想知道你的电脑里有没有幻灯片
They just want to know if your PowerPoint is on your laptop,

127
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,270
或者要不要连接他们的显示器
or if you're gonna integrate with their monitors.

128
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:18,763
用的是数字信号 模拟信号
Do you need HDMI, VGA,

129
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:20,822
或者直接用复合视频信号
or are you going straight composite?

130
00:05:25,903 --> 00:05:29,454
这些信号都是啥
H-G-D... what?

131
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:31,833
都是技术上的东西
It's pretty technical.

132
00:05:31,858 --> 00:05:33,798
有孩子以前 我是做销售的
I only know about it because I used to work in marketing

133
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,090
所以有些了解
before we had kids, and I lost

134
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:38,129
另外我跟老婆扳手腕 输了的人带孩子
a very high-stakes arm wrestle to my wife.

135
00:05:39,663 --> 00:05:41,496
- 你以前做过销售 - 没错
- Y-you were in marketing?  - Mm-hmm.

136
00:05:41,777 --> 00:05:44,502
你介意帮我们完成展示吗
Oh, hey, would you mind if we ran our presentation by you?

137
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,132
等等 打住
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

138
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:47,757
- 怎么 - 我才是管销售的
- What? - I'm our marketing guy.

139
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:50,216
让小黛比操心零食就好了
Let Little Debbie here take care of the snacks.

140
00:05:51,203 --> 00:05:54,137
但小黛比听起来很懂行
Yeah, but Little Debbie sounds like he knows what he's doing.

141
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:55,761
我很喜欢昵称
Okay, I like that we have nicknames,

142
00:05:55,786 --> 00:05:58,954
但更希望你们能考虑一下"冠军"或"童子军"
but maybe we could try something like "Champ" or "Scout".

143
00:05:59,928 --> 00:06:01,857
我不想到那以后跟个外行一样
I don't want to go in there and look like amateurs.

144
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:03,767
我们不需要那些东西
Well, I'm just saying, I don't think we need all that stuff.

145
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:06,195
但我们在面对一个新局面
Well, I'm just saying this is a whole new ball game.

146
00:06:06,197 --> 00:06:09,231
洛厄尔 告诉我几个高科技名词
Lowell, back me up with some of your nerd words there.

147
00:06:10,027 --> 00:06:12,334
来呗 小童子军 说吧
Come on, Scout, speak up.

148
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:15,556
我很喜欢这个名字 谢谢
Well, I loved that. Thank you.

149
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:18,574
总的来说 这些大公司听推介报告时
Um, generally, when these big companies hear pitches,

150
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:20,809
希望看到多媒体化的展示
they're expecting a multimedia presentation.

151
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:22,611
动画制作 3D模型都可以
Animation, 3D models.

152
00:06:22,613 --> 00:06:24,213
有需要 我可以帮助你们
And I'd be happy to help if you want.

153
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:26,815
- 太好了 - 不 谢谢
- That sounds great. - No, thanks.

154
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,051
你为什么要反对
Why are you getting your back up?

155
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:31,253
因为这会议是我争取的 最后也是我来拍板
Because I got the meeting, and I'll close the deal.

156
00:06:31,255 --> 00:06:33,055
一直以来都是如此
It's what I've done since we started.

157
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:35,083
现在 先失陪了
Now, if you'll excuse me,

158
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:36,525
蘸酱搞得我肚子疼
this dip has upset my stomach,

159
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:38,827
我想回家休息了
and I would like to be at home.

160
00:06:40,398 --> 00:06:42,998
如果它让你不舒服 你为什么还要带走
Well, if it made you sick, why are you taking it with you?

161
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,600
等我好点了再吃
So later, when I feel better,

162
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:46,769
就能知道是不是它的问题
I can eat it again and make sure that's what it was.

163
00:06:51,653 --> 00:06:53,042
今晚跟洛厄尔相处得怎么样
How'd it go tonight with Lowell?

164
00:06:53,044 --> 00:06:55,945
他还不错 唐有点问题
Uh, he was fine. Don was the problem.

165
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:57,112
他是不是吃多零食
Did he eat too many snacks

166
00:06:57,114 --> 00:06:58,681
又拉肚子了
and have to take his pants off again?

167
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:01,250
不 不是
No, no, no, no.

168
00:07:01,252 --> 00:07:03,586
洛厄尔说要帮我们做一个高科技的推介
Lowell offered to help us make a more high-tech pitch,

169
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:05,879
可把唐惹毛了
and Don got all bent out of shape.

170
00:07:06,012 --> 00:07:06,922
他裤链都开了
His fly was down,

171
00:07:06,924 --> 00:07:08,958
但我觉得那只是意外
but I think it was just a coincidence.

172
00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:11,300
不算意外
Well, it's not a surprise.

173
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:13,729
唐从来都不爱学新东西
I mean, Don is not a huge fan of knowledge.

174
00:07:14,549 --> 00:07:16,198
还记得我们给他每日一词日历时
Remember how mad he got when we gave him

175
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,934
- 他怒火中烧 - 没错
- that word-of-the-day calendar?  - Yeah.

176
00:07:18,936 --> 00:07:20,202
他有一个理论
Yeah, he's got this theory

177
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:21,870
认为他的脑子和胃一样
that his brain is like his stomach.

178
00:07:21,872 --> 00:07:23,038
进去一些新的
Every new thing he takes in

179
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,311
就会挤出来一些旧的
pushes an old thing out.

180
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:26,942
我必须给唐的脑子腾出空间
I've got to make room in Don's brain

181
00:07:26,944 --> 00:07:28,677
放洛厄尔的点子
for Lowell's ideas.

182
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:30,879
好吧...
Well...

183
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:33,115
我很高兴看到你和洛厄尔相处不错
I'm just excited that you got along with Lowell.

184
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:35,484
你有没有告诉他今天相处很愉快
Did you tell him how much fun you had hanging out with him?

185
00:07:37,855 --> 00:07:39,555
男人从来不这么做
Men don't do stuff like that.

186
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:45,094
洛厄尔发来的
It's from Lowell.

187
00:07:45,096 --> 00:07:47,263
"和你一起玩感觉真不错"
"I had so much fun hanging out with you."

188
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:52,101
笑脸☻ 流星🌠 冰球
Smiley face, shooting star, hockey puck.

189
00:07:52,502 --> 00:07:54,864
你必须给他回信息 说点好听的
You have to e-mail him back. Something thoughtful.

190
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:56,171
你能不能别再逼我
Will you stop trying to make me do

191
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:58,173
和另一个男人做奇怪的事
weird things with other men?

192
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,277
她也这么说
That's what she said.

193
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:06,849
拜托 这确实是那个梗
Come on, that was solid.

194
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:09,692
我确实应该回信息
But I should write Lowell back.

195
00:08:09,717 --> 00:08:10,919
他提出要帮忙
He is offering to help me.

196
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:12,921
要不你来
Uh, well, you do it.

197
00:08:12,923 --> 00:08:14,156
我不擅长这些
I'm bad at these.

198
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:17,359
说一点既随意又爷们的话
Just say something breezy, yet manly.

199
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:19,028
有趣
Oh, fun.

200
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,898
"和你一起玩很开心
Okay, "Great hanging out with you, too.

201
00:08:23,685 --> 00:08:26,302
"你的裤子超级可爱...
"Your pants were super cute...

202
00:08:27,953 --> 00:08:29,662
好基友"
bro."

203
00:08:30,794 --> 00:08:33,075
有意思
Very funny.

204
00:08:35,112 --> 00:08:36,712
你已经发送了吗
Did you actually send that?

205
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:38,537
快撤回
Get it back.

206
00:08:38,562 --> 00:08:40,215
太晚了
It's too late.

207
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:43,085
你有个新男朋友了
You have a new boyfriend.

208
00:08:46,023 --> 00:08:47,189
好了 小豆丁
Okay, Butterbean,

209
00:08:47,191 --> 00:08:49,291
乖乖上学好吗 亲一个
Have a great day, huh? Mwah.

210
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:51,026
对了 你的零食
Oh, listen, for your snack,

211
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:54,196
我放了爆米花和薄荷糖
I gave you popcorn with Junior Mints.

212
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:56,732
真的吗
Shut... up.

213
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:59,580
我就知道你会喜欢
I know, you're gonna love it.

214
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,103
亚当 亚当
Adam! Adam!

215
00:09:02,514 --> 00:09:04,021
嘿 洛厄尔
Hey, Lowell.

216
00:09:04,046 --> 00:09:06,452
早上好 "基友"
Good morning, "bro."

217
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:08,444
你看到我的短信了
Ah, so you got my e-mail.

218
00:09:08,702 --> 00:09:11,035
我太激动了 我做了一个动画
I was so pumped, I made an animated graphic

219
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,748
是关于你们公司的商标的
of the Burns Brothers logo to show you what I was

220
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,950
昨天晚上提到过 看看吧
talking about last night... take a look.

221
00:09:18,756 --> 00:09:22,291
我的天 我们的名字在房子外面炸开了
Wow, our names exploded right out of that house.

222
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:23,992
你能发给我吗 这样我就能给唐看了
Hey, can you send that to me so I can show it to Don?

223
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:25,127
他会喜欢的
I think he'll really love it.

224
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:26,507
早就发了 已发送
Already did. Already sent it.

225
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:29,498
这只是个开头
This is only the beginning.

226
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,167
我要让你爱上我的演示报告
I can make a presentation that you'll like even more

227
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:34,080
比我的裤子更爱哦
than my super cute pants.

228
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:37,106
你的语气在短信里不太一样
You know, your tone is very different in e-mails.

229
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:40,676
是的 活脱脱我老婆的口吻
Yeah, people say I sound just like my wife.

230
00:09:41,105 --> 00:09:42,580
安迪发的短信 是吗
It was Andi, wasn't it?

231
00:09:42,605 --> 00:09:44,179
- 实话说...- 别回答了
- Well, to be honest... - Don't answer.

232
00:09:44,181 --> 00:09:46,482
让我继续高兴下去
I just want to ride this rainbow.

233
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:54,356
我的天 我们的名字在房子外面炸开了
Wow! Our names just exploded out of that house!

234
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:56,308
做得不错 我喜欢
Nice job. I love it.

235
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,793
不是我做的 是洛厄尔
I didn't make it, Lowell did.

236
00:09:57,795 --> 00:10:00,095
什么破玩意
I hate it.

237
00:10:00,804 --> 00:10:02,406
你到底怎么回事
What is your problem?

238
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:04,233
这是我和你的生意
Our business is just you and me.

239
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:06,502
我负责招徕生意 你反正就做些那啥
I'm the sales guy, and you do whatever you do.

240
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:07,836
建筑
The work?

241
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,972
我就是觉得三这数字不吉利
I'm just saying three's a bad number.

242
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:11,330
肯定有人被挤出去
Somebody's gonna get pushed out,

243
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:12,808
我不喜欢这样
and I don't like it.

244
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,511
你总是担心被挤出去
You're always worried about something getting pushed out.

245
00:10:15,513 --> 00:10:18,847
又不是所有的东西都跟你肚子一样 唐
Not everything is like your stomach, Don.

246
00:10:18,849 --> 00:10:21,350
我真的觉得应该让洛厄尔帮我们
I really think we should let Lowell help us.

247
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:22,584
我不准
Well, I forbid it.

248
00:10:22,586 --> 00:10:24,720
我们是合作伙伴 你不能直接不准
You can't forbid it, we're partners.

249
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:26,255
好 投票表决
Fine, let's take a vote.

250
00:10:26,847 --> 00:10:28,123
我们之前试过
We've tried this before.

251
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,692
只有我们俩 永远都不行
There's only two of us. It never works.

252
00:10:30,694 --> 00:10:32,161
行不行试试看
Well, let's just see what happens.

253
00:10:32,163 --> 00:10:33,328
赞同的举手
All in favor?

254
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:36,035
反对的举手
All opposed?

255
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:38,901
我都不知道我为什么要配合
I don't know why I even do it.

256
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:43,572
你在学校和亚当处得怎么样
So, um, how's it going at school with Adam?

257
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:46,685
还好 还好
I, uh, it's f-fine. Fine.

258
00:10:47,558 --> 00:10:49,611
你们又闹矛盾了
Aw, did you guys have another fight?

259
00:10:49,613 --> 00:10:52,147
恰恰相反
On the contrary.

260
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:55,050
跟你说 算了 其实也...
Um, uh, y-you know what, never mind. It's...

261
00:10:55,052 --> 00:10:57,653
求你了 说嘛
Ah, come on. Spill it.

262
00:10:57,655 --> 00:10:59,888
你不说我是不会罢休的
I'm not gonna drop it until you tell me.

263
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:01,601
你不会有意见吧
You won't judge?

264
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:03,525
我就是有也不让你看出来 怎么样
You won't know if I do, how about that?

265
00:11:06,538 --> 00:11:07,429
昨天晚上
Last night,

266
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:09,531
我做了一个关于你老公的梦
I had a dream about your husband.

267
00:11:09,891 --> 00:11:11,291
有点
It was...

268
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,996
不可描述
Cinemax-y.

269
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:20,943
亚当和我
And Adam and I were,

270
00:11:20,945 --> 00:11:23,145
你懂的 啪啪啪
you know, boom-chucka-chucka.

271
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:26,148
还有音效
And sound effects.

272
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:33,856
想不到你竟然把整个演示都做好了
Wow. I can't believe you got the whole presentation done.

273
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:37,392
你是怎么做到让一只秃鹰站到我肩膀上的
And how did you get a bald eagle to land on my shoulder?

274
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:41,230
首先就是要有信心
The first thing I did was believe it was possible.

275
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:44,733
你确定唐没问题吗
Hey, are you sure Don's gonna be okay with this?

276
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:48,036
他要是看到这个 他肯定激动得不得了
Oh, when he sees this, he is gonna be more than okay with it.

277
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:49,705
让我来负责搞定唐 好吗
You know what, let me worry about Don, okay?

278
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:50,772
我们再看一遍
Let's watch it again.

279
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:56,400
洛厄尔在这干什么
What is Lowell doing here?

280
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,248
唐 我还以为你今晚要上班卓琴课呢
Don, I thought you had a banjo lesson tonight.

281
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,884
我老师去船上表演去了
My teacher got a gig on a riverboat.

282
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:04,152
正好你回来了
Well, hey, I'm glad you're here.

283
00:12:04,154 --> 00:12:05,621
快来看看洛厄尔的演示
Check out Lowell's presentation.

284
00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:07,422
你就是在干这个
That's what you're doing?

285
00:12:07,424 --> 00:12:09,324
我不敢相信你竟然背着我搞这样的事
I can't believe you would go behind my back.

286
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:12,060
我是为了咱俩的生意 我只是想得到那笔项目
Well, I'm doing it for us. I'm trying to get us this job.

287
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:13,472
我否决了
But I forbade it.

288
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,631
我觉得你错了
Well, I think you were wrong.

289
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:17,676
我们要不要投票
Should we vote on it?

290
00:12:18,132 --> 00:12:19,768
你们要怎么投票 只有...
How're you gonna vote on it, there's only the...

291
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,204
别别别说了
Don't-Don't-Don't even.

292
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:24,473
你真是太固执己见了
Look, you're being pigheaded.

293
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:25,527
你来看一眼
Just take a look at it.

294
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:27,509
不用 我看得很明白
No. I've seen all I need to see.

295
00:12:28,011 --> 00:12:29,191
接下来
Here's what's gonna happen:

296
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,950
我自己一个人给丽莎·麦卡弗里做演示
I'm gonna do the presentation to Lisa McCaffrey on my own,

297
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:34,583
不跟你还有你新死党一道
without you or your new best friend.

298
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:35,913
哦 是吗
Oh, really?

299
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:38,687
你非要固执己见 搞黄我们的生意吗
So, you're gonna be so stubborn that you ruin it for both of us?

300
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:40,923
没错 你要是想见她的话
Yes. And if you want a meeting with her,

301
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:43,825
你自己抽时间去帮她加鳄梨酱吧
you can go guac her taco on your own time.

302
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:51,133
好的 重点是 我是你的新死党
Okay, the headline is I'm your new best friend.

303
00:12:57,185 --> 00:13:00,153
就算是唐 这反应有些偏激了
Wow, that sounds like a real overreaction, even for Don.

304
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,046
他就跟头驴一样倔
He is stubborn like a mule.

305
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:06,870
还跟驴一样 你要是在他后头走 他就踹你
Also like a mule, you can't walk up behind him or he'll kick you.

306
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,599
所以有两头驴在闹别扭咯
Uh-huh, so there are two mules in this fight.

307
00:13:11,144 --> 00:13:12,580
等等 我为什么是驴
Wait, why am I a mule?

308
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:16,440
我跟你吵过多少次架了都 我的朋友
Oh, please, I have had many a fight with you, my friend.

309
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:17,496
你告诉我
What, you're telling me

310
00:13:17,521 --> 00:13:19,658
对方提出了一个特别棒的观点
that you change your mind when you hear a good argument

311
00:13:19,683 --> 00:13:20,915
你会改变注意吗
for the other point of view?

312
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,709
别人有了再说
Well, I'll let you know when I hear one.

313
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:27,952
很显然对于唐来说 这不仅仅是拿到一份工作
Look, obviously for Don, this is about more than getting a job.

314
00:13:27,977 --> 00:13:30,351
有时候看起来是一回事
I mean, sometimes things seem like they're about one thing,

315
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,642
但其实不是那么一回事
but they're really about something else.

316
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,039
- 你这么觉得 - 嗯呐
- You think? - Yeah.

317
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:37,572
就像 罗德里格兹老师跟你做的春梦
Like... Mrs. Rodriguez had a sex dream about you.

318
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:39,755
这就是因为
That's got to be

319
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,296
另外一回事了
about something else.

320
00:13:41,585 --> 00:13:42,544
啥
What?!

321
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:44,917
是你编出来的还是真的
Did you just make that example up or is that real?

322
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:46,802
就算是我编的...
Let's just say I made it up...

323
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,071
但货真价实
but it's real.

324
00:13:50,378 --> 00:13:52,037
我在学校还得跟她碰面
I have to see her at school.

325
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:54,429
你干嘛跟我说这个
Why would you tell me that?

326
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:56,342
因为我想看看
Well, because I wanted to see

327
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:58,557
她告诉我的时候我是什么表情
what my face looked like when she told me.

328
00:13:58,775 --> 00:13:59,987
所以 现在
So, you know...

329
00:14:00,012 --> 00:14:00,769
我看到了
got it.

330
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:02,357
别介 光是唐的事
Come on, I already got

331
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:03,832
就把我搞得焦头烂额了
my hands full with Don.

332
00:14:03,857 --> 00:14:05,448
好吧 
Okay. I mean...

333
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,046
那你有没有想过
All right, well, did you even try to find out

334
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:08,648
唐到底在烦什么呢
what's really bothering Don?

335
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:13,352
再说一次 你不了解男人做事的方式
Once again, you have no concept of how men do things.

336
00:14:13,843 --> 00:14:16,489
好吗 我们不讨论感受
Okay? We don't ask about feelings.

337
00:14:16,491 --> 00:14:19,907
感受很久以前就被发明出来了
Feelings were invented a long time ago,

338
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,562
这样女人们才有饭后谈资
so that women would have something to talk about

339
00:14:22,564 --> 00:14:23,763
在洞穴里待着
back at the cave...

340
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:27,049
而男人们外出狩猎
while men were out hunting.

341
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:30,336
好的
Okay.

342
00:14:30,865 --> 00:14:32,338
好 那你有什么招
So, what's your plan?

343
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:33,847
我会用我一贯的风格
I'm gonna handle things with Don

344
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,789
跟唐解决好的
the way I always handle things with Don.

345
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:37,842
就是互相折磨互相伤害
By torturing and harassing each other

346
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:39,362
永远做不成什么事
and never accomplishing anything.

347
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,348
这就是传说中的"猫和老鼠"模式
Also known as the Tom-and-Jerry method.

348
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,250
嘿 嘿 嘿
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

349
00:14:44,252 --> 00:14:48,287
随你怎么说 这俩可是风靡一时的好莱坞明星
Say what you will, those two guys took Hollywood by storm.

350
00:14:56,503 --> 00:14:57,915
我的椅子呢
Where's my chair?

351
00:15:00,034 --> 00:15:01,868
你可以去移动公厕看看
You might want to look in the Porta Potti.

352
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,904
不行啊 因为我把移动公厕
Well, I can't because I had the Porta Potti

353
00:15:04,906 --> 00:15:06,906
都堆到你门前了
towed to your front porch.

354
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:08,979
享受那酸爽吧
Enjoy the smell.

355
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:11,110
太幼稚了
That is so juvenile.

356
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:13,279
是啊
Yeah, well...

357
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:17,383
我抽屉里怎么全是布丁
My drawer is full of pudding.

358
00:15:17,937 --> 00:15:21,454
留个惊喜 我做了相当多的布丁
I'm not gonna ruin the surprise, but I made a lot of pudding...

359
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,991
然后把它们放满了每个角落
and it's in a lot of places.

360
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:27,527
你真的觉得没有我的帮助你可以做这个报告吗
You really think you can do this presentation without my help?

361
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:28,937
为什么不可以 你还认为
Why not? You think you can

362
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,516
没有我的帮助你可以做这个报告呢
do the presentation without my help.

363
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,875
我可没这么说
That's not what I said.

364
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,921
对不起 我听不到你说话
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

365
00:15:32,946 --> 00:15:35,111
我的耳朵朝的是另一个方向
My ears are facing the other direction.

366
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,069
好了 你知道吗
Okay, you know what?

367
00:15:37,071 --> 00:15:38,636
我要去外面干活了
I'll be outside working.

368
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:40,828
你准备好道歉了就叫我 
Call me when you're ready to apologize, huh?

369
00:15:44,955 --> 00:15:46,779
我找到剩下的布丁了
I found the rest of the pudding.

370
00:15:48,234 --> 00:15:49,446
你觉得就这些吗
Oh, you think so?

371
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:53,703
好了 快点 艾米
Okay, come on, Emme.

372
00:15:53,728 --> 00:15:55,965
赶紧在罗德里格兹老师回来之前离开
Hurry up before Mrs. Rodriguez gets back.

373
00:16:00,764 --> 00:16:02,176
你瞅啥
What are you looking at?

374
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,430
你瞅啥
What are you looking at?

375
00:16:05,572 --> 00:16:06,734
安迪告诉你了
Andi talk to you?

376
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,901
很不幸 是的
Unfortunately, yes.

377
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,603
现在我没那么冷血了 是吧
I'm not ice-cold now, am I?

378
00:16:14,742 --> 00:16:18,211
我们以后得让你搭顺风车回家了
We have got to get you in a carpool.

379
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:21,913
你在这干什么
What are you doing here?

380
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:23,549
我收到你发的电子邮件
I got an e-mail from you

381
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,518
说你想道歉
saying you wanted to apologize.

382
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:28,387
我们来听听 然后我好拒绝你
Let's hear it so I can say no.

383
00:16:29,402 --> 00:16:31,724
我没给你发邮件 你个大狒狒
I didn't e-mail you, you big baboon.

384
00:16:36,197 --> 00:16:37,430
还是我真发了
Or did I?

385
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:39,484
你把手机落在这里了
You leave your phone out,

386
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:41,200
美好的事情便发生了
beautiful things happen.

387
00:16:42,047 --> 00:16:43,436
如果他不道歉的话
Well, I'm not gonna stay here

388
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:44,637
我是不会呆在这里的
if he's not gonna apologize.

389
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,340
我是不会道歉的
Well, I'm not apologizing.

390
00:16:46,365 --> 00:16:48,274
好了 猫鼠游戏到此为止
Okay, all right, Tom and Jerry, that's it.

391
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:50,643
现在由我来做主 坐下 坐下
I am in charge now. Sit down. Sit down.

392
00:16:53,415 --> 00:16:56,388
好了 显然问题越陷越深了
Okay, now, obviously something deeper is going on here,

393
00:16:56,413 --> 00:16:58,079
我们找找根源
and we need to get to the bottom of it.

394
00:16:58,275 --> 00:17:00,386
唐 你说说你为什么生亚当的气
Now, Don, why are you so mad at Adam?

395
00:17:00,806 --> 00:17:04,507
因为他是个蛮横的老板 他总是这样
Because he's a bossy boss and he's always a bossy boss.

396
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:07,629
好了 好了
Okay. Okay.

397
00:17:07,654 --> 00:17:10,448
我听到的是 唐觉得
Um, and what I'm hearing is that, uh, Don feels like

398
00:17:10,473 --> 00:17:12,387
你从来不听他的想法
you don't listen to him and his ideas.

399
00:17:12,412 --> 00:17:14,320
净说瞎话
That's a bunch of crap.

400
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,746
好了
Okay.

401
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:18,216
我觉得亚当是说
I-I-I think what Adam is saying is

402
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:19,865
他不知道你是这么想的
he never knew you felt that way.

403
00:17:22,116 --> 00:17:23,943
我是哥哥
I'm the older brother.

404
00:17:24,155 --> 00:17:26,479
有点意思
Interesting.

405
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:27,810
好了
Okay, um,

406
00:17:27,835 --> 00:17:30,575
我觉得唐是说 照道理
I-I-I think what Don is saying is that traditionally,

407
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,451
他应该是你们二人的领导者
he would be the leader in your relationship.

408
00:17:32,453 --> 00:17:35,300
好吧 也许他年长 但是他就是个巨婴
Okay, he may be older, but he's a big baby.

409
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,259
好了
Okay.

410
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:38,464
我觉得亚当是说
Um, I think what-what Adam is saying

411
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:40,926
有时候他觉得你不会为了生意做最好的选择
is that sometimes he feels like you don't do what's best

412
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:42,728
不当彼此是平等的合作伙伴
for the business, like an equal partner.

413
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,706
他从来没把我当做平等的合作伙伴对待
He's never treated me like an equal partner.

414
00:17:45,112 --> 00:17:46,732
你是因为觉得对我有愧
You only asked me to start the business with you

415
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,298
才跟我一起做生意
because you felt sorry for me.

416
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:49,989
- 什么 - 好了 等一下
- What?  - Okay, okay, w-wait.

417
00:17:50,014 --> 00:17:51,677
我觉得唐是说...
I think what Don is saying is...

418
00:17:52,247 --> 00:17:54,774
我觉得他说的挺好的
Oh... oh, I think he actually said it.

419
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:58,837
我只是你那个不能自己处理问题的傻大哥
I'm just your big, dumb brother who couldn't make it on his own.

420
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:00,361
你在逗我吗
Are you kidding me?

421
00:18:00,386 --> 00:18:02,915
我让你跟我一起做生意是因为我需要你
I asked you to do it because I needed you,

422
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:06,052
但你总是一副帮了我大忙的样子
and you've always acted like you were doing me a big favor.

423
00:18:06,054 --> 00:18:07,453
我在升华自我
I was sublimating.

424
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:12,491
是的 我看你那个无聊透顶的每日一词日历了
Yeah, I read that stupid word-of-the-day calendar.

425
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:16,595
谢谢你 让我忘掉了365个绝好的单词
Thanks to you, I forgot 365 perfectly good words.

426
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,498
听着 没有你 伯恩斯兄弟什么都不是
Look, without you, Burns Brothers would be nothing.

427
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,069
我不能像你一样跟别人谈成生意
I can't talk to people and close deals like you can.

428
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,753
你是我们的秘密武器
You're our secret weapon.

429
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:27,079
那是必须的
You bet your ass I am.

430
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:29,151
当你喜欢洛厄尔做的东西时
And when you liked Lowell's thing,

431
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:31,243
我以为你要找别人来取代我
I thought you were trying to find someone to replace me.

432
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,399
你是我的哥哥
You're my brother.

433
00:18:33,424 --> 00:18:36,515
我就算是想也不可能摆脱你啊
I couldn't get rid of you even if I wanted to.

434
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:39,518
我觉得亚当是说他爱你
I think what Adam is saying is he loves you.

435
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:42,488
什么 不不 我没说
What? N-N-No, I'm not. No.

436
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,990
太好了 如果你那么说我就扁你
Well, good, 'cause I would've kicked your ass.

437
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:47,570
噢 他也爱你
Aw, he loves you, too.

438
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,121
好了 听着
All right, look,

439
00:18:50,146 --> 00:18:51,804
如果你不想用洛厄尔的东西作报告
if you want to do the presentation without Lowell

440
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:52,658
我无所谓
that's fine with me.

441
00:18:52,683 --> 00:18:54,010
我宁可丢了工作
I-I-I'd rather lose the job

442
00:18:54,035 --> 00:18:55,468
也不想丢了哥哥
than lose my brother.

443
00:18:57,943 --> 00:19:00,840
我用洛厄尔倒是没问题 只要我们一起做就行
Well, I'm fine using Lowell, as long as we do it together.

444
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,541
很好
Good.

445
00:19:04,374 --> 00:19:07,580
那么我们去你的门移动公厕搬走吧
Okay, so, let's go get that Porta Potti off your porch.

446
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,815
这活可真够脏的
That's gonna be a filthy job.

447
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:12,051
她是这么说的
That's what she said.

448
00:19:20,628 --> 00:19:22,595
- 嘿 亲爱的 - 嘿
- Hey, honey. - Hey.

449
00:19:22,597 --> 00:19:23,947
报告做得怎么样
How was the presentation?

450
00:19:23,972 --> 00:19:26,532
我们把所有人赢的落花流水
Oh, we blew everyone out of the water.

451
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:30,236
所以 想象一下当她把工作给了
So, imagine our surprise when she gave the job to her nephew

452
00:19:30,238 --> 00:19:32,238
她刚被百思买炒掉的侄子时 我们有多惊讶
who just got fired from Best Buy.

453
00:19:33,858 --> 00:19:35,351
亲爱的 真遗憾
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

454
00:19:35,376 --> 00:19:37,343
是啊 但是她正在建的迷你商城
Yeah, but the mini-mall she's building

455
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:40,012
被伯恩斯兄弟建筑拿下了
is going to Burns Brothers Construction.

456
00:19:40,014 --> 00:19:41,893
天啊 这太棒了
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

457
00:19:41,918 --> 00:19:44,116
是啊 她的侄子在建房子的时候就会受罪了
Yeah, that nephew's gonna have a hard time building houses

458
00:19:44,118 --> 00:19:46,752
因为他的手套里全是布丁
when he keeps finding pudding in his gloves.

459
00:19:48,022 --> 00:19:49,069
猜猜谁将会给这些人
And guess who's gonna build

460
00:19:49,094 --> 00:19:50,420
建网站 是我
a website for these guys? Me.

461
00:19:50,445 --> 00:19:52,491
你不用猜了 我只是想说出来
You don't have to guess, I just wanted to say it.

462
00:19:53,097 --> 00:19:54,318
是啊 如果不是你把我们和洛厄尔联系起来
Yeah, and none of it would've happened

463
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:55,857
让我和唐重归于好
if you hadn't put us together with Lowell,

464
00:19:55,882 --> 00:19:57,922
这一切都不会发生
and put me and Don back together.

465
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,666
所以... 谢谢你的多管闲事 
So... thanks for not staying out of stuff.

466
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,003
跟高兴跟你一起干活
Pleasure doing business with you.

467
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:05,070
她是这么说的
That's what she said.

468
00:20:09,011 --> 00:20:10,042
安迪撤了
Andi out.

469
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,692
这梗不错
Now that one was solid. Huh?

470
00:20:18,254 --> 00:20:20,154
我的宝贝在这呢
There's my girl.

471
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:32,914
安迪 安迪
Ugh, Andi. Andi.

472
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:35,273
我刚做了一个特诡异的梦
I just had the weirdest dream.

473
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:40,578
啪啪啪 伯恩斯先生
Boom-chucka-chucka, Mr. Burns.

474
00:20:51,725 --> 00:20:55,208
算了 我心脏可受不了再来一下了
Oh, forget it. My heart can't take another one.
