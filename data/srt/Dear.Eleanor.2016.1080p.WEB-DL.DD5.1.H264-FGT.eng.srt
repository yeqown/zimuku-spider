1
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:25,059
We stand today at the threshold
of a great event.

2
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:30,231
Both in the life of the United Nations
and in the life of mankind.

3
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:35,469
This universal declaration
of human rights may well become

4
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:39,574
the international Magna Carta
of all men everywhere.

5
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:47,417
You only meet your once-in-a-lifetime friend
once in a lifetime,

6
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:49,989
and I had to travel a long way
to realize that.

7
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:53,426
That October,
I'd just turned 15 years old.

8
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:56,261
My mother was dead,
and I thought it was my fault.

9
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:59,033
Home was the last place I wanted to be.

10
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:01,436
I wanted it to swallow me up.

11
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,532
- But she wouldn't let it.
- Thank goodness you're home.

12
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:06,567
Can I run through my speech
with you one more time?

13
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,769
I'm tired of hearing that stupid speech.

14
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:14,208
I just want to make sure I've memorized it
and left nothing out when I introduce her.

15
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:15,343
And I'm nervous.

16
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:17,645
I'm sure Mrs. Roosevelt won't mind
if you leave something out.

17
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,447
You should come with me
to hear Mrs. Roosevelt.

18
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:23,718
You're the future of this country.
You and Max the Wax, God forbid.

19
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:25,419
I mean, things are hard for women today.

20
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,588
When are you gonna learn
that women need to stick together?

21
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,524
I stick together. Me and Max the Wax
are going to the movies later to see Gidget.

22
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,227
Would you at least pick Henry up
from school so that I'm not late?

23
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:34,996
No! Let the little wiener walk. I had to.

24
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:39,670
Thanks a lot. Dinner is in the oven,
make a vegetable and I don't mean corn.

25
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:56,550
One of the most famous stars
in Hollywood history is dead at 36.

26
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,986
Marilyn Monroe was found dead in bed

27
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:01,422
under circumstances
that were in tragic contrast

28
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:04,225
to her glamorous career as a comic talent.

29
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:07,306
On the surface, she seemed to have
such a sensible mind...

30
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,252
She was fate because of me.

31
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:29,594
She was hit by a car.

32
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,928
My mother loved Eleanor Roosevelt.

33
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:14,563
She said she was the greatest First Lady
our country ever had.

34
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:32,246
Women gotta stick together,
don't you know?

35
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,749
- Why can't we have corn?
- No more corn.

36
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,351
Is Dad gonna eat?

37
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:38,195
I don't know. He's busy.

38
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:41,522
He's always busy.
I wish he'd be a pumpkin man again.

39
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:44,825
We're not pumpkin people no more
because Mom's gone,

40
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,428
and he don't give a flip
about pumpkins no more.

41
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:50,731
Heck, I don't think he'd even notice
if one of us went missing.

42
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:54,779
This don't taste like sloppy joe.
I wish Mom could make it.

43
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,745
It's Mom's same recipe,
so quit complaining.

44
00:03:58,372 --> 00:03:59,774
- And we're still a family.
- I'm itchy.

45
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:00,875
Me, too.

46
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,517
It's because you have the chicken pox.

47
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,549
I'm next, ain't I?

48
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:08,418
Warren!

49
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,755
Marilyn, rest in peace.

50
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:14,865
And RIP Jesus.

51
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,493
Elvis?

52
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,194
You chewed up my letter!

53
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,029
- I'm gonna have a serious talk with you...
- "Dear Eleanor...

54
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,464
- ...when I get home.
- "...my name is Maxine Wax,

55
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:24,632
"and I'm 15 years old.

56
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:27,975
"You may have already heard of me
as my family is very famous."

57
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,336
Keep reading.

58
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,239
"I'm writing to you because my best friend
Ellie has gone berserk

59
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,209
"and practically lost her mind.

60
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:38,245
"Her mom died this last summer,
and I know it would mean a lot to her

61
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,214
"if she could meet you
and get some words of encouragement

62
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,749
- "from a real trooper."
- Okay, skip to the end.

63
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:42,850
Right there, Billy.

64
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,286
"Sincerely, sincerely, Maxine Wax.

65
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:46,854
"P.S. You're probably a very busy person.

66
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,823
"You can just send her
an autographed picture of yourself

67
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:50,357
"because that would be neat, too.

68
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,697
"Thanks, Mrs. Roosevelt."

69
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:55,463
I liked maps.

70
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,933
I could look at the State
Farm Road Atlas for hours.

71
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:02,136
Opening it gave you a sense of adventure,
and that everything was possible.

72
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:03,237
Ellie!

73
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:05,306
And that you could plot
a new life for yourself.

74
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:07,613
And the red-lined highways
would take you there.

75
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,012
Ellie, are you up there?

76
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,548
Max the Wax and I are going
to Dairy Deluxe! Wanna come?

77
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,752
Yeah, hold on.

78
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,623
Hi, Annabell.

79
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:21,522
Say...

80
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:22,893
Say, "Hey, Max."

81
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:25,798
Okay.

82
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,303
Come here.

83
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,771
Don't fall. Don't fall.

84
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,502
Hey, look out for her.

85
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:36,604
- What, come on!
- You promised!

86
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:53,954
Hey, did you guys know that Manteca
is the pumpkin capital of the world?

87
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:58,333
I'm serious. Without Manteca
there wouldn't even be a Halloween.

88
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:01,595
- Hey, Billy.
- Don't. Don't start with that again.

89
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,631
- Billy!
- You guys know that

90
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:05,802
- I do not like that, Max!
- Billy!

91
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,443
There's your dad, sitting in his truck
staring at nothing again.

92
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,076
Come on, let's go.

93
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:23,817
Saturdays, we confessed.
Max loved to confess.

94
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,754
One time she was in there
for two whole hours.

95
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:30,291
But I knew my sin was so bad,
no amount of Hail Marys could save me.

96
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:31,461
You're up.

97
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:39,469
I got nine Our Fathers, 10 Hail Marys
and six Acts of Contrition.

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,071
And they want to see me again next week.

99
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:46,607
After confession, we'd go to the movies
with our cleansed souls.

100
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:47,908
We were good for the first two minutes,

101
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,578
and then impure thoughts
about Warren Beatty would creep in.

102
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:51,713
We're going to hell.

103
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:56,984
I understand,
that's probably a good idea. Hi.

104
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,053
I'll give you $250. That's more than fair.

105
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:00,621
$250?

106
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:03,624
I'm sure it is fair,
but Carolina's piano is not for sale.

107
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:06,034
- $300.
- $300.

108
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,362
- Why is your mouth blue, son?
- Don't know, sir.

109
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:11,098
- Jack, go wash your face, okay?
- I did, and it don't come off.

110
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:14,236
The thing is, we're gonna keep
the piano, all right?

111
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,416
Come here, come on.

112
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,287
Oh, my Lord, me, too. Come here.

113
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:31,785
You're hot.

114
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:32,989
It's all right.

115
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,556
Come on.

116
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:39,936
Let's go find him, come on.

117
00:07:57,745 --> 00:07:58,780
Nothing.

118
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,890
Couple of little ladies headed your way.

119
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:05,822
Shit.

120
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,258
Third one's got it.
Fourth one's gonna get it.

121
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:10,057
- Get what?
- Chicken pox.

122
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,825
I'm not gonna get it
because I already had it.

123
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,894
But now she's running a fever
and she won't stop crying,

124
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,130
and somebody's got to take her temperature
and I'm not gonna do it.

125
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,231
Why not?

126
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:19,867
Because it goes up her butt, that's why.

127
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,935
She needs to go to a doctor,
but I'm not grown-up

128
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,845
and I'm not her parent so you gotta do it,

129
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,013
or you can do this.

130
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,476
- Okay.
- You are on your own, buddy.

131
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:30,748
I'll be in the car.

132
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,756
I'm gonna concede this game.

133
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:39,123
Dr. Henning to pediatrics.
Dr. Henning to pediatrics, please.

134
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:43,496
Hi. Thank you.

135
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:45,993
Give her baby aspirin
until her fever reduces.

136
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:47,094
Okay.

137
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,700
She don't look too bad.

138
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:03,588
- I'm trying, Ellie.
- Not hard enough, Dad.

139
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,978
- She still sleeping?
- Yeah.

140
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,069
All the kids are home sick today,

141
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,205
so you're gonna have to stay here
and take care of them.

142
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,182
I have a big history test I can't miss.

143
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,085
Okay, well, I'll...

144
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,055
I'll call Grandma and...

145
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,657
There's a party at Tom's tonight.

146
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,793
- You want to come over?
- No, no, daddy-o.

147
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:57,398
I'm going to Motorcycle Rita's
to get drunk and have sex and do drugs.

148
00:09:57,498 --> 00:09:59,566
No doll's called Motorcycle Rita.

149
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,569
Yes, there is. And that's where
Marijuana Millie's going tonight.

150
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,004
No doll's named Marijuana.

151
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,572
Okay, maybe not your dolls,

152
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,809
but my dolls do a lot of interesting things
yours would never do.

153
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:12,356
Well, my dolls like to go camping
all the time at Lake Don Pedro.

154
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:13,747
And eat tacos and swim.

155
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:17,192
Who cares about tacos and Lake Don Pedro?

156
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,193
What's been up with you lately?

157
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,257
I thought we were playing dolls
and having fun and stuff like that,

158
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:25,860
and all of a sudden
your doll is out of control.

159
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:29,263
- Millie used to own a bakery.
- She sold it.

160
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:31,001
Can't be naked and own a bakery.

161
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,034
I'm going home.

162
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:35,969
Wait.

163
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,905
I thought we were gonna make s'mores,

164
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:41,043
and camp out in the backyard with the
Little Elvis and play records all night long.

165
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:43,811
It's not gonna be any fun
if it's just me and him.

166
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:46,213
Aren't we a little old
to be playing with dolls?

167
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,657
Yeah, that'll be the day.

168
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:51,462
I'll see you later.

169
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,069
Come on. Ellie's all right.

170
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,938
You have no idea how bad it is, Billy.

171
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:13,607
She's no fun anymore.
She doesn't even want to play dolls.

172
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,108
You guys still play dolls?

173
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,643
Stop giving me the business.

174
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:20,418
How would an autographed picture
of Mrs. Roosevelt make Ellie be fun again?

175
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:21,918
It just would.

176
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,686
Billy, I'm 15 years old, okay?

177
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:29,393
Fifteen is the age when girls start
to lose it and Ellie's almost 16.

178
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,191
- So what do you think that means?
- I really...

179
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,328
- I really have no idea.
- Of course, you're a boy.

180
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:37,030
Are you going
to the Rock Around the Clock hop?

181
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,134
If no other fellow has asked you to go,
we could go together.

182
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:43,804
I mean, I'm sure... I'm sure
that you have a lot of guys you like, so.

183
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,817
Listen, Billy,
'cause I'm only gonna say this once.

184
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:51,283
I know you think us girls think about
you guys all the time, but we don't.

185
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:52,813
Okay?

186
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,415
So I'll see you soon.

187
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,885
And next time, can I have my cone swirled
instead of just plain vanilla?

188
00:11:57,985 --> 00:11:59,720
And can you dip it, too, please?

189
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,766
- Yeah, sure.
- Au revoir.

190
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:10,935
"Dear Max,

191
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:14,004
"thank you so much for your letter.

192
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,507
"At the moment,
I'm out of pictures of myself.

193
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,477
"But I was thinking

194
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,744
"maybe someday you and your friend Ellie

195
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:26,347
"can come to visit me
at my home in New York.

196
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,252
"Sincerely, Eleanor Roosevelt."

197
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,833
Now you look like you came from New York.

198
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,744
- Don't forget to check the mail, by the way.
- All right.

199
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:06,520
Guess what? Okay, I wrote
a letter to Eleanor Roosevelt

200
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,722
to get an autographed picture for you
and she wrote me back,

201
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:12,770
and she wants to meet us, so pack your bags
because we're going to New York!

202
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,038
We're going to New York!

203
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:17,864
Gee whiz!

204
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,268
...rainfall have left many homes
in the metro area knee deep in floodwater.

205
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:23,737
Power was out for three hours
in eastern metro

206
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:27,741
because of downed hydro-fines
and police report at feast 200 accidents.

207
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,843
No injuries were reported.

208
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,481
The search for escaped prisoner Frank Morris
and the Anglin brothers has been called off.

209
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,750
The three escaped from Alcatraz
five months ago,

210
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,852
but no bodies have been recovered.

211
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:10,587
I don't know why
I said those things to my mother.

212
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:14,089
I regretted them
the second they fell out of my mouth.

213
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:16,865
My mother never gave her speech.

214
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,267
She never got to meet Eleanor Roosevelt.

215
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,029
But I could.

216
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:39,480
Heads,

217
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:41,984
I go.

218
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,861
Tails,

219
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,154
I don't.

220
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,440
We're gonna get to see
the whole country, Ellie.

221
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:05,038
- Gosh, I love America.
- You've never even been out of Manteca,

222
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:07,982
and New York's a metropolis.
And you can't drive.

223
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:11,078
Yeah, I can. My mom was a feminist.
She taught me early.

224
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,180
Yeah, her mom's a feminist,
and I'm gonna be one, too.

225
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,115
You don't even know what that means.

226
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:18,251
It means you're gonna stay home
and take care of the Little Elvis, Billy!

227
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:21,054
Do you think she's gonna make us
recite the pledge of allegiance?

228
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,292
Maybe.

229
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:25,935
She wrote to you.
Why can't you be satisfied with that?

230
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,962
We should go visit my Aunt Daisy
in Las Vegas.

231
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:32,566
And I also want to stop by the actor studio
to give that Lee Strasberg a holler.

232
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,935
- Who's Lee Strasberg?
- Wait, who's Aunt Daisy?

233
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:36,639
I got a picture of her right here.

234
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,706
- What happened to her head?
- Little Elvis ate her face off.

235
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:43,043
She's really cool. She's a showgirl
and she has her own theater on the strip.

236
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:45,078
This is gonna be so boss.

237
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,080
So we're gonna skip school on Friday,

238
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,583
and I'll tell my dad I'm staying with you
over the weekend,

239
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:52,552
and you tell your mom
you're staying with me over the weekend,

240
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,895
and then when they find out,
we'll already be long gone.

241
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,157
You two don't have no money.

242
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:59,059
Shut your mouth, Billy.
I know where we can get some.

243
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:03,237
Yeah. Stop giving us the business, Billy.
We know where we can get some money.

244
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,648
Why are you touching Mom's piano?

245
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,062
I can touch it if I want.

246
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:28,064
Dad don't want no one
touching Mama's piano.

247
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:31,191
If I told you a good secret,
would you help me out?

248
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,194
But you have to promise
not to tell a soul, not even Dad.

249
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,263
Dad don't want me
keeping secrets from him!

250
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:37,933
I'm doing something for Mom.

251
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,233
But to do it,

252
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,601
I have to sell her piano.

253
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:44,237
And if she were here right now,
she'd be okay with it

254
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,908
because people are more important
than stuff, right?

255
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:51,988
I'll give you 5 bucks.

256
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,809
My mom and Marilyn Monroe
died on the same day.

257
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:55,076
I imagined Marilyn picking my mom up
like some kind of girls' night out.

258
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,444
Just the two of them.

259
00:17:57,544 --> 00:18:01,890
The 1948 Chrysler Windsor
with a drop top in Robin's egg blue?

260
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,424
- The very one.
- Smile!

261
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,319
We're going to New York!

262
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,366
They'd hop into Marilyn's pink Thunderbird
and hit the road.

263
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,031
Didn't seem so lonely.

264
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:13,727
Seemed nice.

265
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:28,446
V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N, in the summer sun!

266
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:31,451
Put away the books, we're out of school

267
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:34,614
The weather's warm but we play it cool

268
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:38,924
We're on vacation in the summer sun!

269
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,958
How many miles to New York?

270
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:43,323
3,000

271
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:44,791
- You kidding me?
- No.

272
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:48,328
And here is our money.

273
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,530
That's all we've got
so put it in a safe spot, okay?

274
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,033
Holy moly, that's a lot of moolah.

275
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,477
I don't think I've ever seen
this much money in my whole life.

276
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,378
- All safe.
- Great.

277
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:02,153
Okay, I was gonna wait,

278
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:06,457
but since we're about to have
the time of our lives...

279
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,516
Okay, just some pictures of Mrs. Roosevelt

280
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:12,285
that I cut out of the library books
during study hall.

281
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,254
And I thought that we could put
some of our own pictures

282
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:17,198
- and some stuff in the back, too.
- Thanks, Max.

283
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:19,131
Okay.

284
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,802
Close surveillance

285
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:32,714
of the Soviet military buildup
on the island of Cuba

286
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,774
- within the past week...
- This place is a real dump.

287
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:39,312
...unmistakable evidence has established
the fact that a series of offensive

288
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:43,758
missile sites is now in preparation
on that imprisoned island.

289
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,586
The purpose of these bases

290
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,555
- seems to be none other...
- It just ate my quarter again!

291
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:52,501
...than to provide a nuclear strike capability
against the Western hemisphere.

292
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:57,263
And having now confirmed and completed
our evaluation of the evidence

293
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,365
and our decision on a course of action,

294
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,501
this government feels obliged to report...

295
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:05,171
A rodent just walked through the bathroom.
He did not look like the Little Elvis.

296
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,439
Well, who did he look like?

297
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,348
Like a little Jerry Lee.

298
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,952
Several of them include
medium range ballistic missiles.

299
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,954
- I think Steve will like this one.
- Capable of carrying a nuclear warhead

300
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:18,318
for a distance of more than
1,000 nautical miles.

301
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,523
Each of these missiles, in short,

302
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:23,390
is capable of striking Washington, D.C.,

303
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,867
the Panama Canal,

304
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,227
Cape Canaveral, Mexico City,

305
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:29,963
or any other city in the southeastern part
of the United States.

306
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,197
Why is he talking about missiles?

307
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:34,210
In central America,
or in the Caribbean area.

308
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:37,508
Additional sites, not yet completed,

309
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:41,508
appear to be designed for
intermediate range ballistic missiles

310
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,410
capable of traveling more than...

311
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:48,323
Capable of striking most of the
major cities in the western hemisphere.

312
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:51,651
- Ellie?
- My fellow citizens, let no one doubt...

313
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,620
- Where's the western hemisphere?
- ...that this is a difficult

314
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,221
and dangerous effort

315
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:57,490
- on which we have set out.
- It's right here.

316
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,595
No one can foresee precisely
what course it will take,

317
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:05,465
and what course or casualties
will be incurred.

318
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:09,510
Many months of sacrifice
and self-discipline fie ahead.

319
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:12,338
Months in which both our patience...

320
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:15,078
- Commies want us bad, Little E.
- ...and our willpower will be tested.

321
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:18,513
God willing, that goal will be achieved.

322
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:21,082
Thank you and good night.

323
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:28,088
I think we should go home.

324
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:29,629
I'm not going home.

325
00:21:29,923 --> 00:21:33,370
And besides, even if we did,
we'd still be in the western hemisphere.

326
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,597
I knew those Soviets were up to something.

327
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:40,143
You know, they've been quiet
for a really long time.

328
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:49,383
- Good night, Ellie.
- Good night.

329
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,221
There it goes!

330
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,887
What are you doing out of your house?

331
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,858
I should set you free
behind the Bank of America.

332
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:02,894
But I won't.

333
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:06,768
Max would kill me,
and it would ruin my chances with her.

334
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:08,328
What was I thinking, Little E?

335
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:11,331
What's Mrs. Roosevelt gonna think
when those two crazy girls show up?

336
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:14,640
They're gonna call the cops and
they're gonna get arrested for trespassing.

337
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,375
Then I'll go to Folsom

338
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,441
for forging and impersonating
a former First Lady.

339
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,950
We have to stop them from ruining my life.

340
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,355
Yours, too.

341
00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:44,631
Jack! Henry!

342
00:22:49,002 --> 00:22:50,538
Where's your mother's piano?

343
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:52,007
It's right there, Dad.

344
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:53,907
Right where?

345
00:22:54,007 --> 00:22:56,920
- Right where it's always at.
- I see it.

346
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,111
Yeah?

347
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,615
Robert!

348
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,356
What, Dad?

349
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,391
Where's the piano?

350
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:07,221
It's right in front of you, Dad.

351
00:23:10,023 --> 00:23:11,093
Ellie?

352
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,392
She's at Max's.

353
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:14,894
They're working on
an outer space project for school.

354
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:17,099
Yeah, she won't be back until next week.

355
00:23:17,297 --> 00:23:19,004
- Where's the baby?
- Kitchen.

356
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:22,602
Boys...

357
00:23:22,702 --> 00:23:24,804
Why don't you play something for us
on the piano, Dad?

358
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,940
What the hell is the bird
doing in the house?

359
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,741
Bird? What bird?

360
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:31,511
- Don't you give a hoot no more, Dad?
- Yes, son.

361
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:33,181
I give a hoot!

362
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,095
Zion National Park.

363
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:57,537
- Where'd you put the map?
- It's in the back seat.

364
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,920
- Should be right on top, right?
- Yeah.

365
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,612
Well, it's...

366
00:24:05,712 --> 00:24:07,658
- It's not back here.
- Yes, it is.

367
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,254
No, it's not.

368
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:10,990
- It's not?
- No.

369
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:18,229
I think I left it at home.

370
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:20,762
- You think anyone's gonna find it?
- I don't...

371
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,998
No. No one goes in my room. It's fine.

372
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:27,800
Yeah, Mrs. Wax, I'm just trying
to find my daughter. Boys!

373
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,570
So, yeah, so unless their project
has something to do...

374
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,805
- Dad!
- ...with making themselves invisible,

375
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:34,040
they're not here. Now I...

376
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,009
- Dad!
- What is it, Jack?

377
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:37,744
- When Ellie gets back from New York...
- Right, yes.

378
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:40,381
...can we go to Kentucky Fried Chicken?

379
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,739
It starts here, Manteca, where we are,

380
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,574
goes across the entire country,

381
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:12,622
all the way across
to Eleanor Roosevelt, okay?

382
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:13,780
Ellie's gone.

383
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:19,952
Okay, Johnny, I need you to go put out
an APB for me, son. Okay? Real fast.

384
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:22,032
Fast as you can. Call headquarters.

385
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:27,135
Hey, you kids listen to your grandma!

386
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,635
That, Mr. President, is the Soviet
Foreign Minister's public statement

387
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:39,273
about the policy of the Soviet Union
and of Cuba in this western...

388
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:41,040
I told you I knew how to drive, Ellie.

389
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,944
Max, see, for people to sleep,
you have to be quiet.

390
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:48,181
...the general assembly
on Cuba's foreign policy.

391
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:51,551
Faithful to these principles
of his international policy

392
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:55,121
and to the principles enshrined
in the charter of the United Nations.

393
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,859
Cuba constitutes a danger...

394
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,598
They're selling radiation-proof huts
over at McRooters.

395
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:05,898
Get this, Phil's got a scam.

396
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:10,071
Selling his cotton briefs
as bomb resistant underwear.

397
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:12,905
Bomb resistant underwear?

398
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:15,417
- That's $9.72.
- We should get some.

399
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:18,911
Have you girls seen the news?

400
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:20,747
Yeah. Do you guys sell that here?

401
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:22,326
You girls aren't
from around here, are you?

402
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:25,084
- No, we're from California.
- California.

403
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:27,120
- That must be nice.
- Yeah.

404
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,722
You have relatives in Colorado?

405
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:34,335
Why are we in Colorado, Max?
We went the wrong way.

406
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:36,195
Well, which way are we headed now?

407
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:38,965
North. Where did you go
while I was sleeping?

408
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:40,066
Not the right way?

409
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,135
Where is it y'all trying to get to anyhow?

410
00:26:42,235 --> 00:26:45,409
We're going to see Eleanor Roosevelt.
She's a close personal friend.

411
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:49,008
- Do your parents know where you are?
- Yeah, of course, it was their idea.

412
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,678
They gave us plenty of money.

413
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,015
Listen, why don't you come home with me
to my ranch?

414
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,918
You can stay for a couple of days
till we know what's happening.

415
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:01,020
Call your parents, tell them you're safe.

416
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,222
It's a nice little ranch. I have horses.

417
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:06,995
What do you say?

418
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:09,337
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah.

419
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:10,833
Totally boss, okay.

420
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,999
I'm gonna get... Yeah.

421
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:14,867
And... And this.

422
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,345
- Max, I already have one.
- Steve will like this one, too.

423
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:24,778
You having fun, Little E?

424
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:42,367
We gotta go back for him.

425
00:27:51,404 --> 00:27:53,042
Need a ride, sir?

426
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:56,175
Billy Hobgood?
What the hell are you doing out here?

427
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,944
I'm just out seeing the sights.

428
00:27:58,044 --> 00:28:01,814
Yeah? Well, I'm out here looking for
my daughter, and my truck broke down.

429
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,018
That's what I'm doing.

430
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:04,784
Well, I can give you a ride.

431
00:28:04,884 --> 00:28:05,852
In this?

432
00:28:05,952 --> 00:28:07,158
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah?

433
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,133
This vehicle make it across country?

434
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:11,724
- I think so.
- Yeah?

435
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:13,226
- Yeah.
- Okay. Good.

436
00:28:13,326 --> 00:28:15,928
Because I know where they're going.
I got their map.

437
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,196
My daughter, she's just...

438
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:21,133
She's been acting out a little bit lately
and just having a hard time,

439
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:23,002
and just been dealing with that,

440
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:25,938
so I called the police and put out
an APB, so took care of all that.

441
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,707
- Really, sir?
- Yeah.

442
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:29,684
- You did that?
- I did.

443
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:36,018
Son, you got nothing to do with this,
do you? And be honest with me.

444
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:37,317
No, sir.

445
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:39,952
- All right, well, start it up.
- Yes, sir.

446
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,988
I'm not gonna ride
in the buddy-seat, though.

447
00:28:42,088 --> 00:28:44,034
You have to, sir.

448
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,466
- And also, you have to hold the Little Elvis.
- Weird kid.

449
00:29:00,373 --> 00:29:04,583
And he might poop in your pocket,
so don't get too mad.

450
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,759
Max, I don't know if this is a good idea.
We don't even know these people.

451
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:22,194
She seemed really nice,
and I really want a home cooked meal

452
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,171
and a bathroom without rodents.

453
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:30,037
Hope you girls are hungry.
Dinner's almost ready.

454
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:31,904
Yeah, I'm starving.

455
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:34,314
This place is great.
Can we go horseback riding?

456
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,380
Yeah, I'm sure my son can take you out.

457
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,322
There he is. Bud! Bud!

458
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:51,796
Splendor in the Grass.

459
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:55,005
- He looks just like...
- Warren Beatty.

460
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,229
Howdy. I'm Bud.

461
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,399
I'm Max.

462
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:00,099
- Ellie.
- Nice to meet you both.

463
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:01,467
- They're staying with us...
- Bud. Nice to meet you.

464
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:03,302
...until we get an all-clear
from the President.

465
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:04,710
Well, great. Well, welcome.

466
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:10,376
- Y'all coming?
- Yeah.

467
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:11,511
Yeah.

468
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:14,285
- Charlotte's quite the cook.
- Hold this, Max.

469
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:26,726
Be sure to call your parents right after
dinner and let them know you're okay.

470
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:27,861
Okay.

471
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:33,408
You're squeezed in mighty tight
over there, ain't you?

472
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:40,973
Do you guys want to hear
my greatest idea ever?

473
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:42,313
Homing pigeons.

474
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,352
Does this have anything to do
with what you did to the Little Elvis?

475
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:50,092
No. Take a pigeon,
and I drive it to a movie star's house.

476
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:51,386
Pick somebody!

477
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:53,088
Warren Beatty.

478
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,401
I don't think he likes birds, but I like
the way you're thinking. Charlotte.

479
00:30:58,157 --> 00:30:59,363
Marlon Brando.

480
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:02,072
Yes, Brando.

481
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:04,997
So, I ride my bike with the pigeon
over to Marion's house,

482
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:07,466
show her Marlon's house, drive home,

483
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:11,103
and then I write a note that says,
"I love you, Marlon Brando.

484
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,877
"Will you marry me?
Check the box, 'yes' or 'no."'

485
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:15,908
Then I tape it to the pigeon's leg

486
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:18,844
and it flies to my fiance's house
and gives him the note.

487
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:21,981
Wait, the pigeon gives Marlon the note?

488
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:24,250
Boom. Flying fan-mail.

489
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,658
That's impossible, Max.

490
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:27,553
No, it's not, because I know
where we can get a pigeon.

491
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:29,388
Yeah, well,
the pigeon's not the hard part.

492
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:32,628
The making him fly with a note taped
to his leg to Marlon Brando's house?

493
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:34,160
- Yeah, that's impossible.
- It's impossible.

494
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,398
"Stella!"

495
00:31:37,263 --> 00:31:39,432
I know this guy in Detroit
who got a pigeon

496
00:31:39,532 --> 00:31:42,172
and he drove to his girlfriend's house
in Arkansas.

497
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:44,904
And then he drove home to Detroit,
and the next day

498
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:47,644
the pigeon showed up
on her doorstep in Little Rock.

499
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:51,444
There's a million pigeons out there.
That could have been any bird in Little Rock.

500
00:31:51,544 --> 00:31:53,023
- True.
- With a note?

501
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:54,780
"I could have been somebody.

502
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,791
"I could have been a contender."

503
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:04,025
Y'all want to go
squirrel hunting tomorrow?

504
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,132
Hey, Max?

505
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:17,648
I'm pretty sure I saw Frank Morris
at the store today.

506
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,343
Who's Frank Morris?

507
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:22,279
The mastermind who escaped Alcatraz.

508
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:25,615
Well, Billy says
nobody makes it off Alcatraz alive.

509
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:28,481
Billy doesn't know anything.

510
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:30,526
Well, why was he on the Rock?

511
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,123
I don't know. Probably murder.

512
00:32:35,688 --> 00:32:37,395
All I'm saying is,

513
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,769
I'm pretty sure
I saw him steal crackers today.

514
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:45,773
I need a cigarette.

515
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:47,867
I'll be right back.

516
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,077
You know, smoking's bad for you.

517
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:58,277
Well, not that it matters.

518
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:02,692
We're all gonna die anyway.
After all, this is the western hemisphere.

519
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,888
Can I bum one?

520
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:08,156
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

521
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:17,768
You look like Warren Beatty.

522
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,168
Do I make you nervous?

523
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:24,440
No.

524
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:30,246
- How old are you?
- 17.

525
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:35,948
You know you're not inhaling that, right?

526
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:38,324
- What?
- Here, go like this.

527
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:46,092
Try it.

528
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:49,466
There you go.

529
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:51,372
You got it, you got it right.

530
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,203
So, Why'd you run away from home?

531
00:33:56,602 --> 00:33:59,173
- I... I didn't.
- Sure you didn't.

532
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:02,547
You know you can tell me.
I ain't gonna turn you in.

533
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:05,247
I didn't run away from home. I'm...

534
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:06,716
I'm on vacation.

535
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:10,127
Hey, you wanna see something cool?

536
00:34:11,684 --> 00:34:14,062
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Come on. Let's go.

537
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:17,290
Come on.

538
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:21,600
It's beautiful, huh?

539
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,262
Yeah.

540
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,375
They're not 17.

541
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:45,349
Look at this postcard
Max asked me to mail.

542
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:49,114
"Dear Steve,
it's your favorite 15-year-old again.

543
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:51,116
"I was in the great state
of Utah recently.

544
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:54,356
"This is what my motel looked like.
Sincerely, Max the Wax."

545
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:59,591
I mentioned calling their parents,
they changed the subject,

546
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:02,061
so I'm gonna call the police
in the morning.

547
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:03,504
I think they're runaways.

548
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:05,732
Why don't you call Max's father?

549
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,833
I don't have his phone number.

550
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,536
You don't have
Steve McQueen's phone number.

551
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:12,172
I don't think so.

552
00:36:12,538 --> 00:36:13,778
You better not.

553
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,816
Wake up. We're leaving.

554
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:26,218
Why? Did your boyfriend
break up with you already?

555
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:27,753
What? No.

556
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:32,458
"Dear Steve McQueen, it's your favorite
15-year-old again." That's what it is.

557
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:35,505
Charlotte thinks we're runaways.
She's calling the police.

558
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:39,604
Charlotte's making chocolate
chip pancakes for breakfast.

559
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:43,402
Gosh, we don't have time
for chocolate chip pancakes!

560
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:44,503
Ellie!

561
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:45,638
Get up.

562
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:53,579
You kissed him, didn't you?

563
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,747
Are you kidding me right now?

564
00:36:54,847 --> 00:36:56,382
Why'd you have to tell everyone
Steve McQueen's

565
00:36:56,482 --> 00:36:58,150
- your dad in the first place, Max?
- You know,

566
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,719
sometimes you have to believe
stuff like that, Ellie.

567
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:01,787
You don't know.

568
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:05,057
You know, maybe Steve likes my cards,
and maybe one day,

569
00:37:05,157 --> 00:37:08,260
he'll pick me up in his corvette and give
Dave the what's what for a whole day.

570
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,237
And it'll be great...

571
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,197
- What was that?
- I don't know.

572
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:14,777
- Max, what was that?
- I don't know. You hit it.

573
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:16,502
Oh, my God, it was a squirrel!

574
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:20,305
- No, no, no, no! I killed a squirrel.
- You hit a squirrel!

575
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:23,475
- Why would you do that, Ellie?
- Because I was distracted.

576
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:28,354
- Well, why were you distracted?
- Because you won't stop talking.

577
00:37:28,514 --> 00:37:30,215
- Oh, my God.
- One of the reasons that you like me

578
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:31,658
is because I talk!

579
00:37:32,384 --> 00:37:33,419
You know what?

580
00:37:33,886 --> 00:37:34,920
Are you serious right now?

581
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,256
I hate to say it,
but it's a great addition to the scrapbook.

582
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:38,424
I'm done.

583
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:40,526
- I'm done. Stop! Hush!
- You're...

584
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:42,069
Don't talk.

585
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,338
Let's drive in peace, please.

586
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:51,413
This trip is a disaster.

587
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:53,339
A complete disaster.

588
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:58,811
- Can we just go see Aunt Daisy now?
- Fine. Fine.

589
00:37:58,911 --> 00:37:59,981
Who's Aunt Daisy?

590
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:05,584
- Stop. Stop. Stop screaming!
- We're just kids!

591
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:07,459
Are you the mastermind from Alcatraz?

592
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:09,955
- Is that what they're calling me now?
- I knew it was you!

593
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:11,523
I knew it was you, Frank Morris.

594
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,331
- It's Frank Morris?
- Yes! This is Frank Morris!

595
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:17,262
- We're going to die. We're gonna die!
- I'm not dying in Colorado!

596
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:20,639
Hold on, no one's going to die.
Now calm the hell down.

597
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:23,635
You know what?
Before you do this, you should know

598
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,571
that I am just like you, okay?

599
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:29,483
I put laxative in my teacher's coffee
and she was out of school for two days.

600
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:31,343
I have a longer rap sheet than you, Frank.

601
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:34,390
I am bad. I am bad, all right?
I am... Ellie, I am bad.

602
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:36,048
Max, hey, give him the money.

603
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:37,116
We don't have any money.

604
00:38:37,216 --> 00:38:38,650
- Give him the money, Max!
- We do not have any money!

605
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,319
I don't want your money.

606
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:41,987
I don't need to go back to prison.
I want something else.

607
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:43,455
You are not gonna get any of the money!

608
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:44,761
Relax.

609
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:47,596
I just need a ride.

610
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:01,440
Okay.

611
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:06,445
Now, we're gonna walk in calmly,
sit down nicely

612
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:08,582
and you're gonna act like I'm your pa.

613
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:25,364
This is Sunset Boulevard,
Los Angeles, California.

614
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:26,798
It's about 5:00 in the morning.

615
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:29,868
That's the homicide squad complete
with detectives and newspapermen.

616
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:32,204
A murder has just been reported
from one of those great big houses...

617
00:39:32,304 --> 00:39:33,739
- What are you talking about?
- ...on the 10,000 block.

618
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,008
- Monologue. You can't stop her.
- You'll see it in the late editions.

619
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:37,442
- Monologue?
- I'm sure. It'll play over your radio.

620
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,710
And you'll see it on television.

621
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,913
Because an old time star is involved.

622
00:39:41,013 --> 00:39:42,253
One of the biggest.

623
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:46,485
But before it gets all distorted,
blown out of proportion,

624
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:49,794
before those Hollywood columnists
get their hands on it,

625
00:39:50,022 --> 00:39:52,093
maybe you want to hear the facts.

626
00:39:53,025 --> 00:39:54,927
If so, you've come to the right party.

627
00:39:55,027 --> 00:39:57,496
- Make her stop.
- I can't. She's gotta finish.

628
00:39:57,596 --> 00:40:00,736
You see, a young man was found dead
in her mansion swimming pool.

629
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:03,702
Two shots in his back
and one in his stomach.

630
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:05,003
No one important, really.

631
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:08,414
Just a movie writer with a couple
of B pictures to his credit.

632
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,678
The poor dope. He always wanted a pool.

633
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,218
Well, in the end, he got himself a pool.

634
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:18,555
Only the price turned out
to be a little high.

635
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:24,523
- Hey, Delores.
- Hey, how are you? Good to see you.

636
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:26,068
Hey, Officers.

637
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:31,072
How's your night going?

638
00:40:32,064 --> 00:40:34,772
Let's sit up near the bar here.

639
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:36,504
Cool.

640
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:41,707
You rat me out,

641
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:44,376
and I'll tell them
that you're juvenile delinquent runaways,

642
00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:47,480
and you'll be the ones
trying to find your way off Alcatraz.

643
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,130
Man, this is tepid.

644
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,200
Hey. Hi.

645
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:05,864
Can you heat this up for me?

646
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:10,379
And can you also put some more of that
"pff, pff," on top? Thanks.

647
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,106
Coming right up.

648
00:41:13,038 --> 00:41:15,374
I hear you have to eat slop
in prison, Frank. Is that true?

649
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:17,743
You say another word
and that's all you'll ever eat.

650
00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:20,653
No more "pff, pff," ever, you hear me?

651
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:23,257
I'm in charge now.

652
00:41:24,216 --> 00:41:25,251
Okay.

653
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:31,260
You know, none of this would have happened
if you didn't take us on that stupid detour.

654
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:33,091
- Don't blame me.
- Like, didn't you?

655
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:34,393
Yeah, well, whoop-de-doo.

656
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:35,836
That should have been a clue.

657
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:39,364
You meet a guy who looks like
Warren Beatty and ride a horse.

658
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,099
None of that would have happened
if it wasn't for me.

659
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,335
Yeah, if it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be stuck with this guy!

660
00:41:43,435 --> 00:41:45,404
- Hey, hey, hey. Sit down.
- I'm not gonna sit down.

661
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:48,273
If you didn't write that stupid letter
to Eleanor Roosevelt in the first place,

662
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:49,808
we wouldn't be
in this predicament right now.

663
00:41:49,908 --> 00:41:52,010
I only wrote that letter, Ellie,
because I'm your best friend

664
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,783
and I didn't want you to end it.

665
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:57,149
Maybe you just should have, because
you're not the only one with problems.

666
00:41:57,249 --> 00:41:58,417
- Thank you.
- Come back soon, now.

667
00:41:58,517 --> 00:41:59,751
Will you shut up, Max?

668
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:00,852
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

669
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:03,021
You kissed Bud
when you knew that I liked him.

670
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:05,924
- This is about scoring Warren?
- Yeah, it's about scoring Warren!

671
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,927
Sol kissed him. Big deal.
We're never gonna see him again.

672
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,629
- Sit down.
- I'm not gonna sit down.

673
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:12,798
- You know one more thing?
- I blame you

674
00:42:12,898 --> 00:42:14,566
for not letting me eat
those chocolate chip pancakes.

675
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,501
Chocolate chip pancakes! Come on.

676
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:18,437
My mom doesn't even care about anything

677
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:20,572
other than stupid Cream of Wheat
and I gosh-darn hate it!

678
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:22,743
- She's driving me nuts.
- No, you don't!

679
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:27,680
- You're welcome. You're crazy!
- You're crazy!

680
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:33,719
Frank.

681
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:36,332
This is for your own good, okay?

682
00:42:44,596 --> 00:42:46,974
I thought you knew me
better than this, Max.

683
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:49,969
I do.

684
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:54,981
Besides, I think
I like somebody else anyway.

685
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:03,151
Hey, buddy?

686
00:43:05,717 --> 00:43:08,019
I got two kids just like that at home.

687
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:10,725
Hey, take a napkin. Clean yourself up.

688
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,599
Cops won't give a reward
to a couple of kids.

689
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:18,897
They'll just say we're runaways
and send us home.

690
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:21,477
Definitely, definitely no cops.

691
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,605
My gosh, here he comes.

692
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:28,048
- What?
- Lock the door.

693
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:36,887
Come on, open up.

694
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:38,152
Open the door.

695
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:43,188
- Open the door.
- What's on your face?

696
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:45,624
- Open the door.
- No, Alcatraz man.

697
00:43:45,724 --> 00:43:47,260
I already bailed you out once.

698
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:51,997
- What's he doing?
- I don't know!

699
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:54,966
"Want to hear a story
about right-hand, left-hand?

700
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:57,002
"A story about good and evil?"

701
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:59,070
- Okay, I know this one. My gosh!
- "H-A-T-E."

702
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,173
- It's going to kill me. I know this one.
- "It was with this hand

703
00:44:01,273 --> 00:44:04,609
"that old brother Cain struck the blow
that laid his brother low.

704
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:06,711
"L-O-V-E.

705
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:08,647
"You see these fingers, dear hearts?

706
00:44:08,747 --> 00:44:11,650
"The veins go straight
to the soul of a man.

707
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:14,128
"The right hand, the hand of love.

708
00:44:15,287 --> 00:44:17,995
"Let me tell you a story,
a story about life.

709
00:44:18,757 --> 00:44:20,896
"These fingers, they were...

710
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,261
"They were a-warring and a-fighting,

711
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:26,965
"one against the other,
and old brother left hand,

712
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:30,235
"he was a-fighting
and it looked like love was a goner,

713
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,973
"but wait a minute.

714
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:34,205
"Wait a minute.

715
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:37,075
"Love. Love was a-winning.

716
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,678
"Hot dog, love was the winner.

717
00:44:39,878 --> 00:44:41,880
"Old left hand, hate,

718
00:44:42,747 --> 00:44:43,815
"he was down for the count."

719
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:45,917
Night of the Hunter, Robert Mitchum!

720
00:44:46,918 --> 00:44:48,022
Loved that.

721
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:49,461
Don't leave me out here.

722
00:44:50,922 --> 00:44:51,957
I think we should take him, Ellie.

723
00:44:52,057 --> 00:44:54,799
Heck, this guy's better than Brando.
I can learn a lot from this fellow.

724
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:06,240
- Night of the Hunter, huh?
- You got it.

725
00:45:07,005 --> 00:45:08,040
I got it.

726
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:14,290
Did you work a lot on your fitness
in prison, Frank?

727
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:16,815
Not a lot else to do on the Rock.

728
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,490
It shows.

729
00:45:23,955 --> 00:45:26,691
Is it wrong to think
a convict is cute, Ellie?

730
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:30,329
He's an old man. He's probably already 30.

731
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,318
Everything's A-okay, Mr. Potter.

732
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:55,125
My parents are glad I'm gone.

733
00:45:55,987 --> 00:45:58,900
- Got fired from Dairy Deluxe, though.
- It happens.

734
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,161
- Can I ask you a question, sir?
- Right now?

735
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,797
How come you gave up pumpkins?

736
00:46:05,163 --> 00:46:06,364
How come I did what?

737
00:46:06,464 --> 00:46:09,568
You're not really a farmer anymore, sir.
All your pumpkins are rotting.

738
00:46:09,668 --> 00:46:12,571
I just see you sitting in your truck
doing nothing. It's creepy.

739
00:46:12,671 --> 00:46:16,074
I don't know why you'd call it
creepy, son. I mean,

740
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:18,143
I don't get the problem
you kids have with that truck.

741
00:46:18,243 --> 00:46:21,986
I just enjoy sitting in there
and smoking the occasional cigarette.

742
00:46:22,347 --> 00:46:24,793
I like it. Makes me feel good.

743
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:27,852
See, I think you might get confused
sometimes because, you know,

744
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,522
you're just a little kid.

745
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:31,923
You know, what are you? About 12?

746
00:46:32,023 --> 00:46:33,091
- Sixteen, sir.
- Okay.

747
00:46:33,191 --> 00:46:34,960
Well, see, I'm a grown man,

748
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:41,433
and sometimes grown men do things
that younger people don't understand.

749
00:46:41,533 --> 00:46:43,435
It doesn't make sense to you
'cause you haven't...

750
00:46:43,535 --> 00:46:46,605
You haven't been around,
and I don't just mean

751
00:46:46,705 --> 00:46:48,241
been around town, I mean you haven't...

752
00:46:49,074 --> 00:46:51,743
You haven't been alive that long,
so you don't really know

753
00:46:51,843 --> 00:46:55,380
what in the hell's going on a lot of the time,
so you get kind of confused like...

754
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,515
Like you do.

755
00:46:57,115 --> 00:46:58,287
But...

756
00:46:59,517 --> 00:47:04,159
I appreciate your being interested
in how I spend my private time.

757
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:07,525
Why don't you finish up?

758
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,104
- We gotta get back out on the road.
- Yes, sir.

759
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:12,397
You gotta... You gotta keep eating

760
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:15,171
- and just don't talk for a minute, okay?
- Yes, sir.

761
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:19,971
Dazzling Daisy's Palace, showtimes,
all right, 2:00, 4:00 and 6:00 p.m.

762
00:47:20,071 --> 00:47:21,379
What time is it, guys?

763
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,809
- All right, comes to 5 and 30.
- It's 1:30.

764
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:27,583
Well, hurry up! We can make it!

765
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,249
Charleston Chew?
How did you know I like Charleston Chew?

766
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,818
I want a bite.
Everyone likes candy, Frank.

767
00:47:33,918 --> 00:47:35,192
It's not that, it's my favorite.

768
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:42,460
If I hear this song again,
I'm gonna kill someone.

769
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,130
- That's not funny, Frank.
- Relax, it's just a euphemism.

770
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:48,033
- What's a euphemism?
- A nicer way of saying something.

771
00:47:48,133 --> 00:47:50,579
- Like, lovin' them up?
- Yeah.

772
00:47:52,237 --> 00:47:54,046
Frank, guess what I just did.

773
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:55,543
I don't know. What?

774
00:47:55,974 --> 00:47:58,511
I just ate a peanut M&M
with two nuts in it.

775
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:02,414
So, tell me about this Aunt Daisy.

776
00:48:02,514 --> 00:48:06,551
She was a big Broadway showgirl
until she married my Uncle Rocko,

777
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:09,354
and he thought it would be better
for her career to move to Las Vegas.

778
00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:12,492
She's the best in the business, Frank,
and an amazing dancer.

779
00:48:13,525 --> 00:48:16,506
Great, make it fast.
I want to get back on the road.

780
00:48:17,095 --> 00:48:19,507
You're not coming in, Frank.
You're staying in the car.

781
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:23,944
Fine. I don't want to see some old lady
doing the splits with a hula-hoop anyway.

782
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,071
I gotta say,
it looks better in the movies.

783
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:30,008
Where's Frank Sinatra
and the Rat Pack and the dancing women?

784
00:48:30,108 --> 00:48:32,310
Where's Bugsy and his bulletproof office?

785
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,948
Max, you didn't think we were going to
Las Vegas, Nevada, did you?

786
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:39,217
Are there two Las Vegases?

787
00:48:39,317 --> 00:48:40,352
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

788
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:44,423
And the one Aunt Daisy lives in,
that's Las Vegas, New Mexico.

789
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,870
All right.

790
00:49:07,045 --> 00:49:09,047
This is certainly a full house.

791
00:49:11,482 --> 00:49:13,318
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

792
00:49:13,418 --> 00:49:20,233
Let's give a warm Las Vegas welcome
for the star of the show, Dazzling Daisy!

793
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:46,185
Let's go find her. Come on.

794
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:53,351
Max, are we supposed to be in here?

795
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:55,226
She's my aunt. I can do what I want.

796
00:50:59,824 --> 00:51:01,201
Gone with the Wind.

797
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:07,198
This is like Clark Gable's suit!
We should get this for Frank!

798
00:51:07,298 --> 00:51:09,209
- This is her stuff.
- I'm going to get it on the way out.

799
00:51:10,435 --> 00:51:12,506
Jeez, she's got a lot of stuff.

800
00:51:13,104 --> 00:51:16,507
Aunt Daisy, are you back here?
It's your favorite niece, Maxine!

801
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,709
Maxie?

802
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:19,577
- Is it really you?
- Yeah.

803
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:21,122
Honey!

804
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,114
What are you doing here?

805
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:25,216
Well, my friend Ellie and I
are on our way to New York.

806
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:26,317
We decided to stop by.

807
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,519
- Ellie, this is my Aunt Daisy.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

808
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,221
- I like your show.
- Thank you.

809
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:33,691
I just started incorporating
the whole hula-hoop thing and, you know,

810
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:35,493
you just never know
how it's gonna turn out.

811
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:39,507
Sensational. Do you live here?
With all this stuff?

812
00:51:40,198 --> 00:51:42,166
Well, you know,
it needs a bit of straightening,

813
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:45,543
but I couldn't imagine
parting with any of it.

814
00:51:46,537 --> 00:51:48,172
This is one of my favs.

815
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:51,685
Worn by the Sandra Church in Gypsy.

816
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:55,381
What about this pizza box?
Can you get rid of this pizza box?

817
00:51:55,513 --> 00:51:56,856
Give it to me.

818
00:51:58,416 --> 00:51:59,517
So, where did you put Uncle Rocko?

819
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:03,121
He vamoosed a long time ago
when he couldn't fit through the door.

820
00:52:05,156 --> 00:52:07,258
Would you girls like some tea and cookies?

821
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:08,359
Yeah.

822
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,461
Great. Coming right up.

823
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:17,236
Look. She circles dance auditions,
but then she just crosses them out.

824
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:23,251
This one's for next week. In New York.

825
00:52:24,442 --> 00:52:25,710
We have to get her to go
to that audition, Ellie.

826
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,445
All right, catch the cookies.

827
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:29,718
My goodness.

828
00:52:30,214 --> 00:52:31,818
- And the tea?
- What?

829
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:35,286
I'm just kidding. I'm not crazy.

830
00:52:35,386 --> 00:52:38,367
Well, I might be a little crazy,
but not that crazy.

831
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:42,304
So, New York City.

832
00:52:43,161 --> 00:52:45,607
My goodness, I love New York.

833
00:52:47,298 --> 00:52:48,800
Yeah, it's just...

834
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,135
It's really lonely on the road,
isn't it, Max?

835
00:52:51,235 --> 00:52:54,472
I have an idea.
Why don't you come with us, Aunt Daisy?

836
00:52:54,572 --> 00:52:56,841
- That's a great idea, Max.
- Isn't that a great idea?

837
00:52:56,941 --> 00:53:01,856
No. I can't go with you guys to New York.

838
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,316
- You won't be gone for long.
- Yeah. Just think of it as a holiday.

839
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:07,259
I can't leave all this.

840
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:11,290
You need to do this.
You see this audition here?

841
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:14,592
You're gonna make this audition,
and we're gonna help you get there.

842
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,561
Daisy, you have to get back out there.

843
00:53:16,661 --> 00:53:21,007
You don't belong here, on this stage.
You need to be on the big stage.

844
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,870
The big stage.

845
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:28,881
Rise and shine.

846
00:53:33,277 --> 00:53:34,779
I got you a present.

847
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:37,615
- Who the hell is this?
- I'm Daisy.

848
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,384
- Daisy, this is...
- Daisy.

849
00:53:39,484 --> 00:53:41,686
- My acting coach.
- Max's acting coach,

850
00:53:41,786 --> 00:53:43,322
- Lee Strasberg.
- Yeah.

851
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:45,890
You're not Lee Strasberg.

852
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:48,493
I met Lee Strasberg,
and you don't look a thing like him.

853
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:49,933
You look familiar, though.

854
00:53:50,261 --> 00:53:52,697
- Must be a different Lee Strasberg.
- Must be.

855
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:54,834
All right, New York, here we come.

856
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:07,338
I gave Lee a couple of egg rolls, but he
said he'd be fine just sleeping in the car.

857
00:55:07,438 --> 00:55:09,315
We should just say, "Dear Ed."

858
00:55:09,674 --> 00:55:12,610
You can't just call him Ed.
Just say, "Dear Mr. Sullivan."

859
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:14,445
Ed is more personal, Ellie.

860
00:55:14,545 --> 00:55:15,613
What are you two bickering about?

861
00:55:15,713 --> 00:55:18,694
Trying to get on The Ed Sullivan Show,
so we can show him our dance.

862
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:22,592
- Your dance?
- It's a tribute to the late, great

863
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:24,730
Marilyn Monroe.

864
00:55:25,456 --> 00:55:26,833
I want to see your dance.

865
00:55:29,427 --> 00:55:30,461
Yeah, put on the record.

866
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:33,440
Well, it'd be much better on a big stage,
but okay.

867
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:40,347
- Good, Ellie?
- Yeah.

868
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,681
How was that?

869
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:53,344
- Amazing.
- Let's do it for Eleanor Roosevelt.

870
00:56:53,444 --> 00:56:56,414
- Showed it to our friend Billy once.
- But he didn't say anything.

871
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:57,848
Okay, it's your turn. Max, get her record.

872
00:56:57,948 --> 00:56:59,188
Yeah!

873
00:57:01,886 --> 00:57:03,297
- This one?
- Yeah.

874
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:06,596
Any song but that song.

875
00:57:08,693 --> 00:57:11,799
You know, as a matter of fact,
I'm not gonna dance tonight.

876
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:20,780
Harry Truman called Eleanor Roosevelt
the First Lady of the world.

877
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:23,407
She answered the door
to the White House herself.

878
00:57:23,507 --> 00:57:25,109
When she wanted to learn how to fly,

879
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:28,012
she got Amelia Earhart
to promise to teach her.

880
00:57:28,112 --> 00:57:31,949
She could only cook scrambled eggs,
and served them on Sundays for dinner.

881
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:36,020
And when the KKK put a bounty on her head,
she put a pistol on the car seat

882
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,589
and drove to Tennessee
to speak on civil rights anyway.

883
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:41,329
Eleanor Roosevelt stood down the Klan.

884
00:58:39,884 --> 00:58:41,056
Good evening,

885
00:58:42,253 --> 00:58:45,166
ladies, gentlemen

886
00:58:46,657 --> 00:58:48,102
and distinguished guests.

887
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,601
Mrs. Roosevelt says

888
00:58:52,163 --> 00:58:53,733
you gain strength,

889
00:58:54,231 --> 00:58:56,302
- courage...
- You all right, Ellie?

890
00:58:58,436 --> 00:58:59,471
Yeah.

891
00:59:01,005 --> 00:59:02,541
What have you got there?

892
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:04,416
It's just a speech.

893
00:59:04,942 --> 00:59:08,151
I'm just having a hard time
memorizing it all.

894
00:59:11,282 --> 00:59:13,626
Is that why you girls
want to go to New York?

895
00:59:14,018 --> 00:59:17,932
So you can deliver a speech
to Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt?

896
00:59:18,823 --> 00:59:20,860
- Sort of.
- That's exciting.

897
00:59:21,759 --> 00:59:22,897
I guess.

898
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:27,665
My mom was gonna do it before she died.

899
00:59:30,201 --> 00:59:33,671
I didn't tell Max just because,
you know, if I can't do it,

900
00:59:33,971 --> 00:59:35,639
or if I chicken out...

901
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:37,842
She just thinks we're going
over there to visit her

902
00:59:37,942 --> 00:59:40,149
and look at her gardens or something.

903
00:59:42,313 --> 00:59:44,520
Why do you not like the dance
Max gave you?

904
00:59:47,318 --> 00:59:50,554
I haven't really danced full out like that
since I was 19 years old.

905
00:59:50,654 --> 00:59:52,361
But you danced in Las Vegas.

906
00:59:52,623 --> 00:59:56,161
Yeah, I mean,
I can cha-cha-cha all day long.

907
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,162
It's not the hardest thing in the world.

908
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:06,714
Remember that outfit I showed you?

909
01:00:06,904 --> 01:00:08,941
- The one from Gypsy?
- Yeah.

910
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:14,845
I was supposed to play the lead in Gypsy
for the Broadway premiere.

911
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:16,117
What happened?

912
01:00:16,747 --> 01:00:18,283
Opening night came.

913
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:22,690
And when it came time for the big number,

914
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:27,098
I couldn't remember a step. Not one.

915
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:33,602
And the audience started laughing.

916
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:35,470
That's awful.

917
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,371
And then the stage hand dragged me

918
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:42,840
all the way to Las Vegas.

919
01:00:43,774 --> 01:00:46,277
Turned out to be Las Vegas, New Mexico,

920
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:48,350
of all places.

921
01:00:49,647 --> 01:00:51,456
- Rocko?
- Yeah.

922
01:00:54,652 --> 01:00:55,858
That Rocker.

923
01:00:59,623 --> 01:01:01,625
He wasn't all that bad, you know.

924
01:01:01,959 --> 01:01:04,963
He built me the theater
because he knew how much I missed it.

925
01:01:07,798 --> 01:01:11,109
But I never found the confidence
I had as a girl.

926
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:15,009
Max is right.

927
01:01:15,873 --> 01:01:20,618
I gotta do this because if I don't
at least try, then I'm really finished.

928
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:27,821
I really want to do this for my mom.

929
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:30,387
Make her proud of me, you know?

930
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:33,701
I've just never done
a speech before, or...

931
01:01:35,793 --> 01:01:36,931
Or anything.

932
01:01:37,695 --> 01:01:39,834
Let's make a deal, all right?

933
01:01:40,397 --> 01:01:41,933
If I do it, you do it.

934
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:43,903
Pinky swear.

935
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:46,305
Okay.

936
01:01:46,971 --> 01:01:48,450
You can do this.

937
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,110
Come here.

938
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:22,181
Police! Open up!

939
01:02:23,741 --> 01:02:26,847
- I swear, if that's Frank...
- That Frank.

940
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:33,990
Eleanor Potter and Max the Wax?

941
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:36,720
- We've been caught.
- Runaways, huh?

942
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:39,256
- All the way from California.
- Are you gonna book us?

943
01:02:39,356 --> 01:02:41,725
- On what charges?
- Juvenile delinquency.

944
01:02:41,825 --> 01:02:43,294
You missed school, you're underage,

945
01:02:43,394 --> 01:02:45,663
and you've given your parents
a first-class heart attack.

946
01:02:45,763 --> 01:02:47,298
Now come on, get dressed
and get your things together.

947
01:02:47,398 --> 01:02:48,877
We're taking you downtown right now.

948
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:53,079
What? Where? All right,
we'll be there as soon as we can.

949
01:02:53,904 --> 01:02:55,673
Okay, they found them in Kentucky.

950
01:02:55,773 --> 01:02:58,742
If we get on, we can get there
in a couple of hours, put an end to all this.

951
01:02:58,842 --> 01:03:00,844
Let's hustle, Hobgood, come on.
There you go.

952
01:03:05,049 --> 01:03:06,917
- This stinks.
- Your dad's on his way.

953
01:03:07,017 --> 01:03:08,496
Hey, copper, how did you find us?

954
01:03:10,821 --> 01:03:13,958
"Dear Steve, how are you? I am fine.

955
01:03:14,058 --> 01:03:17,027
"I'm in Las Vegas, New Mexico,
and I ate an enchilada.

956
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:20,802
"It was real good.
Talk to you soon. Love Maxine."

957
01:03:20,931 --> 01:03:23,067
Here's another one
all the way from Oklahoma.

958
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:27,171
"Dear Steve, guess what I saw today?
Two midgets on a motorcycle.

959
01:03:27,271 --> 01:03:29,740
"I've never seen that before.
Wish you were here.

960
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,841
"Love, Maxine."

961
01:03:30,941 --> 01:03:34,111
And there's another one,
and another one, and another one.

962
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:35,412
How did you get my cards?

963
01:03:35,512 --> 01:03:36,981
We have our ways.

964
01:03:37,081 --> 01:03:40,028
Max, what is wrong with you?

965
01:03:40,918 --> 01:03:42,753
I'm sorry.
I didn't think that we'd get caught.

966
01:03:42,853 --> 01:03:44,822
I should have never gone
on that stupid trip with you.

967
01:03:44,922 --> 01:03:47,163
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
- Yeah, no, you're always sorry.

968
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:57,810
Girls!

969
01:03:58,702 --> 01:03:59,908
- Mom!
- Mom!

970
01:04:01,238 --> 01:04:03,582
I've been worried sick!

971
01:04:05,943 --> 01:04:07,211
Officer.

972
01:04:07,311 --> 01:04:10,047
Sorry, ma'am, I can only release them
to their father, Bob Potter.

973
01:04:10,147 --> 01:04:12,252
What? No. But...

974
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:17,254
But... Dear God!

975
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:21,291
He's sleeping in the car
and he gets so mad when we wake him.

976
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:24,128
Sorry, ma'am, you'll have to wake him.

977
01:04:24,228 --> 01:04:26,397
I have to have his signature
on the release.

978
01:04:26,497 --> 01:04:28,238
God! Really?

979
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,269
Yes, ma'am.

980
01:04:38,008 --> 01:04:39,316
Well, girls,

981
01:04:39,476 --> 01:04:43,080
looks like I have to go wake your father.
He's going to be very upset.

982
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:45,490
He is gonna tan your little hides.

983
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,172
Here I am.

984
01:05:05,302 --> 01:05:06,440
Bob Potter.

985
01:05:08,872 --> 01:05:10,510
- Where do I sign?
- Right here.

986
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,466
- Hi, Daddy.
- Gee, that's a nice suit, Dad.

987
01:05:26,957 --> 01:05:28,800
You two are in deep trouble.

988
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:30,928
Get your stuff. Let's go.

989
01:05:33,897 --> 01:05:34,932
Okay.

990
01:05:35,232 --> 01:05:37,678
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.

991
01:05:47,945 --> 01:05:50,755
You all lied to me.
I didn't know you were runaways.

992
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:53,150
I mean, I knew you weren't Lee Strasberg,

993
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:56,987
but I didn't know you were
the man from Alcatraz. Gee whiz.

994
01:05:57,087 --> 01:06:00,933
You two were hilarious.
You should start up a comedy team.

995
01:06:01,225 --> 01:06:02,670
How did y'all get that money?

996
01:06:03,026 --> 01:06:04,128
Ellie stole it.

997
01:06:04,228 --> 01:06:07,402
I didn't steal anything. I sold something.

998
01:06:07,531 --> 01:06:10,367
That's the thing, see?
You're just helping out a guy.

999
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:13,744
A guy who went to the Rock
for stealing something.

1000
01:06:15,272 --> 01:06:16,979
We're three of a kind.

1001
01:06:17,507 --> 01:06:20,215
What do you mean, my wife picked her up?

1002
01:06:20,577 --> 01:06:23,524
She did. She left here with you.

1003
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:25,182
No.

1004
01:06:25,716 --> 01:06:31,496
She didn't. That's impossible you see,
because I'm here, right now, with you.

1005
01:06:31,688 --> 01:06:34,100
- And my wife, well, she...
- Is dead.

1006
01:06:35,959 --> 01:06:37,427
You let strangers kidnap my daughter?

1007
01:06:37,527 --> 01:06:39,196
- Now, Mr...
- What do these people look like?

1008
01:06:39,296 --> 01:06:40,264
Was it this lady?

1009
01:06:40,364 --> 01:06:41,532
- Was it her?
- Was it this lady?

1010
01:06:41,632 --> 01:06:42,633
Look at it.

1011
01:06:44,701 --> 01:06:45,903
That's Eleanor Roosevelt.

1012
01:06:46,003 --> 01:06:47,337
- Yes, it is. We know that.
- No shit.

1013
01:06:47,437 --> 01:06:50,908
You two little ladies,
what are y'all running from?

1014
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:52,009
Nothing.

1015
01:06:52,109 --> 01:06:53,850
No, you shouldn't run away. You're lucky.

1016
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:57,881
I grew up on the streets making
every bad choice a kid could make.

1017
01:06:57,981 --> 01:07:00,484
I've been in and out of prison
from the time I was 13 years old.

1018
01:07:00,584 --> 01:07:03,394
I was inside longer
than I was on the outside.

1019
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:07,257
Do you know this is
the first road trip I ever took?

1020
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:08,961
My first road trip.

1021
01:07:09,993 --> 01:07:11,267
I gotta say,

1022
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:13,697
I'm having a heck of a time.

1023
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:18,746
All right, well,

1024
01:07:19,636 --> 01:07:21,411
half hour to sunrise.

1025
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:44,500
Frank!

1026
01:07:45,062 --> 01:07:48,665
Why don't you just put the mustache
back on and come with us to New York?

1027
01:07:48,765 --> 01:07:50,176
Can't do it, Max.

1028
01:07:51,535 --> 01:07:52,741
Can't do it.

1029
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:57,608
You could mastermind Alcatraz,
but you couldn't mastermind us.

1030
01:07:57,708 --> 01:07:59,813
Nobody could mastermind you two.

1031
01:08:01,611 --> 01:08:02,681
And Daisy?

1032
01:08:04,715 --> 01:08:05,819
Knock 'em dead.

1033
01:08:09,286 --> 01:08:11,555
I hope they never find you, Frank!

1034
01:08:11,655 --> 01:08:15,068
- Yeah, me, too, Frank! Bye!
- Bye!

1035
01:08:27,504 --> 01:08:30,542
- So long, Frank!
- Bye, Frank!

1036
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:40,553
All right, let's go.
Get in the car, you knuckleheads.

1037
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:56,133
You lock up Elvis Jr.?

1038
01:08:56,233 --> 01:08:58,769
It's the Little Elvis,
and, yep, he's in the tub.

1039
01:08:58,869 --> 01:09:01,238
He ain't going nowhere.
I mentioned to him that we're in Kentucky.

1040
01:09:01,338 --> 01:09:04,374
He just couldn't believe it.
So close to Graceland, yet so far.

1041
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:07,177
- You talk to Little Elvis, do you, Billy?
- Yeah, I do.

1042
01:09:07,277 --> 01:09:09,112
And he wants to know
why you stopped farming pumpkins.

1043
01:09:09,212 --> 01:09:12,816
Give me a break, son, okay?
Been a hell of a long day.

1044
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:14,618
Not in the mood to talk about pumpkins.

1045
01:09:14,718 --> 01:09:17,392
My daughter's been kidnapped
by a strange woman.

1046
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:20,290
Could be Eleanor Roosevelt.

1047
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:22,192
And Franklin.
And you should be happy about that.

1048
01:09:22,292 --> 01:09:24,394
- Franklin's dead.
- Yeah, well they're both Democrats.

1049
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:26,263
That's way better
than just plain old Americans.

1050
01:09:26,363 --> 01:09:29,733
Leave me alone. Let me think.
Thinking portion of the night, okay?

1051
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:32,177
- Gotta formulate a plan.
- Okay.

1052
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:36,749
Little Elvis says
you have a gift for gourds.

1053
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:41,152
And once a farmer, always a farmer.
You can't just stop and be something else.

1054
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,816
- He says you gave up on life.
- Tell Little Elvis to kiss my ass.

1055
01:09:45,916 --> 01:09:47,224
I think he's right.

1056
01:09:47,717 --> 01:09:49,390
You shouldn't smoke in bed.

1057
01:09:49,553 --> 01:09:52,089
You know, growing up, there was
a boy on the farm next to us.

1058
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:54,291
Nice kid, simple, though, like you.

1059
01:09:54,391 --> 01:09:56,460
We wouldn't let him near
any of the farm equipment.

1060
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,439
Wouldn't even let him
sit on a turned off tractor.

1061
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:04,401
Now, here I am, riding cross-country
with you, coast to coast.

1062
01:10:04,501 --> 01:10:05,741
You driving.

1063
01:10:08,605 --> 01:10:09,777
Life's funny.

1064
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:13,879
Well, not funny, but unpredictable.

1065
01:10:15,178 --> 01:10:16,446
Well, I know about life.

1066
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,682
- No, I know.
- I also know about family.

1067
01:10:18,782 --> 01:10:22,594
And how important it is to make sure
that they know how much you love them.

1068
01:10:24,254 --> 01:10:26,323
And that they're connected to something.

1069
01:10:26,423 --> 01:10:30,235
And it ain't enough for you to just go
and find Ellie and bring her home.

1070
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:33,407
Gotta make sure that she has
a real home to come back to.

1071
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:43,573
My gosh, Ellie, you better hurry up
because we're going to be late.

1072
01:10:43,673 --> 01:10:46,676
We're going to miss the audition.
We're already a little late.

1073
01:10:46,776 --> 01:10:48,645
- This is it?
- It's pretty.

1074
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:52,249
- I like it. So ready for this audition.
- Okay.

1075
01:10:52,349 --> 01:10:54,124
Let's go, let's go.

1076
01:10:55,852 --> 01:10:56,887
Okay.

1077
01:10:57,587 --> 01:11:00,290
- All right, where's the dressing room?
- We don't have time for a dressing room.

1078
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:01,691
Come on, let's just get you
dressed, Daisy.

1079
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:03,293
- Here?
- Yeah!

1080
01:11:03,393 --> 01:11:05,462
- Just put this on!
- All right. Unzip me.

1081
01:11:05,562 --> 01:11:08,732
- Sorry.
- It's too tight. I gotta breathe!

1082
01:11:08,832 --> 01:11:10,467
Do you wanna get the part or not?

1083
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:12,302
All right. No breathing.

1084
01:11:12,402 --> 01:11:13,570
- What do you think?
- It's great.

1085
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:15,013
Here. Here.

1086
01:11:15,739 --> 01:11:17,741
- Fluff, fluff, fluff.
- All right.

1087
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:21,714
Hey, look at me.

1088
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:24,083
A deal's a deal, all right?

1089
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:25,752
Pinky swear.

1090
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:27,985
Pinky swear.

1091
01:11:28,251 --> 01:11:29,252
You got this.

1092
01:11:31,354 --> 01:11:33,391
- I have your record.
- Here's your record.

1093
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:36,393
Just one more breath.

1094
01:11:36,493 --> 01:11:37,494
No, no, no. Okay.

1095
01:11:37,594 --> 01:11:38,795
- You can breathe on the way.
- Breathe on the way.

1096
01:11:38,895 --> 01:11:39,896
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Yeah.

1097
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:42,833
- I'm actually pretty nervous.
- You're going to do great. Great.

1098
01:11:42,933 --> 01:11:44,901
Nerves are fine. Nerves are good.

1099
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:47,777
Hi, hello there. Sorry.

1100
01:11:48,438 --> 01:11:49,576
You the 10:00?

1101
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,350
- Daisy.
- Nice to meet you, Daisy.

1102
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:54,778
Let's get started.

1103
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:57,950
- You're late.
- Yes, sir. I'm aware of that, sir.

1104
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,722
She's not a mind reader.

1105
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:08,428
- Excuse me?
- Just hand her the record.

1106
01:12:10,694 --> 01:12:12,332
Could you give her the record, sweetie?

1107
01:12:13,363 --> 01:12:16,776
- The record?
- Yes, yes, yes, sorry.

1108
01:12:18,034 --> 01:12:20,344
- Sorry.
- Whenever you're ready.

1109
01:12:20,737 --> 01:12:22,045
You got this, Aunt Daisy.

1110
01:12:41,491 --> 01:12:42,936
She's incredible.

1111
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,001
That was very nice.

1112
01:15:05,101 --> 01:15:06,739
- Thank you so much.
- Very nice.

1113
01:15:07,036 --> 01:15:09,243
It was the best audition.
They loved you. I could tell.

1114
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:11,374
Those directors went nuts.

1115
01:15:11,474 --> 01:15:14,045
They were smiling,
they were studying you the entire time.

1116
01:15:14,644 --> 01:15:15,714
Mrs. Wax?

1117
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:19,182
We're going to need
some more information from you.

1118
01:15:19,282 --> 01:15:21,091
- Go.
- Great.

1119
01:15:21,251 --> 01:15:22,419
- Aunt Daisy?
- Yes.

1120
01:15:22,519 --> 01:15:25,755
From now on,
no more Las Vegas, New Mexico.

1121
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:27,524
I love you so much.

1122
01:15:27,624 --> 01:15:29,759
Never give up on your dreams, sweetheart.

1123
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:31,600
You're bound for something big.

1124
01:15:33,997 --> 01:15:35,237
And you.

1125
01:15:36,499 --> 01:15:40,503
You give Eleanor Roosevelt
the introduction of a lifetime.

1126
01:15:40,603 --> 01:15:41,604
Okay.

1127
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,650
Make your mother proud.

1128
01:15:44,507 --> 01:15:45,542
Okay.

1129
01:15:51,147 --> 01:15:52,549
I'm going to miss her.

1130
01:15:52,649 --> 01:15:54,484
So long, Aunt Daisy!

1131
01:15:54,584 --> 01:15:55,619
All right, let's go.

1132
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:08,204
Looking for these?

1133
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:09,733
You found them?

1134
01:16:09,833 --> 01:16:12,245
Yeah, you left them in the motel
when the copper snagged us.

1135
01:16:15,405 --> 01:16:16,884
I know it's your mom's speech, Ellie.

1136
01:16:17,574 --> 01:16:18,882
I know what you're doing.

1137
01:16:19,776 --> 01:16:21,010
You think it's stupid, what I'm doing?

1138
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:23,886
No, I don't think what you're doing
is stupid at all.

1139
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:27,325
I actually think
that it's pretty spectacular.

1140
01:16:29,319 --> 01:16:30,696
I know, I was...

1141
01:16:31,588 --> 01:16:34,190
I should have told you.
I should have told you what I was doing,

1142
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:38,395
and I didn't, and out of everyone, you
would have probably understood the most.

1143
01:16:38,495 --> 01:16:39,769
Probably would have.

1144
01:16:42,832 --> 01:16:46,736
Sorry I've been blaming everything on you,
and I've been such an awful friend.

1145
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:49,506
You know, I know that this was
supposed to be this really fun road trip,

1146
01:16:49,606 --> 01:16:51,779
and I know I haven't been
a lot of fun lately.

1147
01:16:54,644 --> 01:16:56,513
Ralph Waldo Emerson says that

1148
01:16:56,613 --> 01:16:59,526
a friend is someone with whom
you can be the most sincere.

1149
01:17:01,251 --> 01:17:05,597
But I prefer that you only meet your
once-in-a-lifetime friend once in a lifetime.

1150
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:07,332
And that's from The Little Rascals.

1151
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:13,706
You know, you're my
once-in-a-lifetime friend, Max.

1152
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,536
You know, I don't really think
you need these, Ellie.

1153
01:17:19,636 --> 01:17:22,549
I heard you rehearsing the other night.
I think you've got it memorized.

1154
01:17:25,241 --> 01:17:26,515
You think I can do it?

1155
01:17:45,895 --> 01:17:47,067
What's happening?

1156
01:17:47,697 --> 01:17:48,767
I don't know.

1157
01:17:56,205 --> 01:17:57,343
Excuse me?

1158
01:17:58,708 --> 01:17:59,743
What's happening?

1159
01:18:00,076 --> 01:18:01,180
Didn't you hear?

1160
01:18:02,946 --> 01:18:05,153
Eleanor Roosevelt died last night
in her sleep.

1161
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:14,532
Wait. Wait, Ellie.

1162
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:18,066
Let's take one more picture.

1163
01:18:31,774 --> 01:18:33,117
Wait, Max, the guards.

1164
01:18:35,144 --> 01:18:36,316
I'll distract them.

1165
01:18:37,747 --> 01:18:40,057
She really had a way with people.

1166
01:18:47,156 --> 01:18:48,430
I still can't believe it.

1167
01:18:49,826 --> 01:18:50,861
Sir?

1168
01:18:51,327 --> 01:18:53,034
Is the news true?

1169
01:18:53,997 --> 01:18:55,271
Is it true?

1170
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:03,239
Get back. Get back, please.

1171
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:06,376
- Please stay back. Are you okay, miss?
- No, I am not okay.

1172
01:19:06,476 --> 01:19:07,955
Sam! Sam, come here.

1173
01:19:08,845 --> 01:19:11,080
- Can I get you anything?
- I am not okay.

1174
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:13,285
- Sam, will you go get me some water?
- She stood down the Klan.

1175
01:20:19,282 --> 01:20:20,420
Good evening,

1176
01:20:22,251 --> 01:20:23,355
ladies,

1177
01:20:25,021 --> 01:20:26,295
gentlemen

1178
01:20:27,056 --> 01:20:28,535
and distinguished guests.

1179
01:20:32,261 --> 01:20:34,969
Mrs. Roosevelt says you gain strength,

1180
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:37,269
courage

1181
01:20:38,201 --> 01:20:39,475
and confidence

1182
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:44,075
by every experience
in which you really look fear

1183
01:20:44,974 --> 01:20:46,044
in the face.

1184
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:47,577
Why?

1185
01:20:48,111 --> 01:20:49,351
Why?

1186
01:20:49,479 --> 01:20:51,117
What the...

1187
01:20:59,122 --> 01:21:00,157
Busted.

1188
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:03,760
Come with me, young lady.

1189
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:05,128
- Give me a second.
- I'm sorry,

1190
01:21:05,228 --> 01:21:06,329
but we're going to have
to break this up now.

1191
01:21:06,429 --> 01:21:07,830
Thank you very much
for paying your respects,

1192
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:09,065
- but it's time to go home.
- Thank you.

1193
01:21:09,165 --> 01:21:11,167
Thank you. Come with me.

1194
01:21:12,835 --> 01:21:14,542
I stand before you tonight,

1195
01:21:15,404 --> 01:21:16,815
doing the thing

1196
01:21:17,907 --> 01:21:19,511
I thought I could not do.

1197
01:21:21,944 --> 01:21:25,050
Speaking before an audience of over 200,

1198
01:21:26,549 --> 01:21:32,693
introducing the woman who has meant
so much to me and so many others,

1199
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:38,898
and having raised a daughter
who I am so proud of.

1200
01:21:40,363 --> 01:21:41,535
And now,

1201
01:21:43,332 --> 01:21:44,970
it is my great honor

1202
01:21:46,903 --> 01:21:48,314
to introduce to you

1203
01:21:49,505 --> 01:21:52,975
the greatest First Lady
this country has ever known,

1204
01:21:54,544 --> 01:21:56,922
the greatest champion of human rights

1205
01:21:59,015 --> 01:22:00,426
and a wonderful mother,

1206
01:22:04,387 --> 01:22:06,060
Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt.

1207
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:15,675
I did it, Mama.

1208
01:22:19,235 --> 01:22:21,237
And I left nothing out.

1209
01:22:27,777 --> 01:22:29,381
How long have you been standing there?

1210
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:33,149
Long enough, young lady.
Now I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1211
01:22:35,651 --> 01:22:38,421
Your dad is here.
We drove across the country together.

1212
01:22:38,521 --> 01:22:41,698
It was a little weird at first,
but I think we're friends now.

1213
01:22:52,401 --> 01:22:53,436
Come here.

1214
01:22:54,103 --> 01:22:55,309
Honey.

1215
01:22:56,706 --> 01:22:58,708
I'm so glad you're safe.

1216
01:23:01,277 --> 01:23:03,120
I'm here to take you home, okay?

1217
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:09,091
I don't know what I'm doing.
I need your help.

1218
01:23:10,219 --> 01:23:12,455
I mean, your brothers
are like little wild animals.

1219
01:23:12,555 --> 01:23:16,469
I wake up, the little one's just
staring at me with those goggles on.

1220
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:18,094
Where the hell did he get those goggles?

1221
01:23:18,194 --> 01:23:20,538
- I don't know.
- And he doesn't speak.

1222
01:23:22,598 --> 01:23:24,100
We can do it, though.

1223
01:23:26,702 --> 01:23:28,579
Did you find what you were looking for?

1224
01:23:32,074 --> 01:23:33,246
I think so.

1225
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:36,246
That's good.

1226
01:23:37,613 --> 01:23:39,024
So did I.

1227
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:40,820
Okay.

1228
01:23:42,218 --> 01:23:45,221
Max, I took care of the Little Elvis
for over 3,000 miles,

1229
01:23:45,321 --> 01:23:48,962
and I wouldn't have done that for anybody
but you because I like you.

1230
01:24:01,137 --> 01:24:03,472
Driving home with my dad, Max and Billy,

1231
01:24:03,572 --> 01:24:06,142
I looked out the window and saw
Marilyn Monroe and my mother

1232
01:24:06,242 --> 01:24:09,121
speeding by in Marilyn's pink Thunderbird.

1233
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:12,319
And I knew right then
that I was gonna be okay.

1234
01:24:13,015 --> 01:24:14,050
And the red line highways

1235
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:18,496
would link us state by state until it
brought us safely back to California.

1236
01:24:18,955 --> 01:24:21,128
Back to the pumpkin capital of the world.

1237
01:24:22,058 --> 01:24:24,265
All in the western hemisphere.

1238
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:42,787
Ellie! Guess what we got
with a postmark from Ireland?

1239
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:44,820
"Dear girls, having the time of my life.

1240
01:24:45,047 --> 01:24:46,482
"I wish you were here. Guess what?

1241
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:49,028
"I just ate a peanut M&M
with two peanuts in it.

1242
01:24:49,318 --> 01:24:51,554
"Your friend and partner in crime,
Lee Strasberg."

1243
01:24:51,654 --> 01:24:53,861
Give me a hand, lover boy.
Hand the baby over.
