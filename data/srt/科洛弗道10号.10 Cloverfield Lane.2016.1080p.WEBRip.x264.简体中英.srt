2
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,630
米歇尔，请不要挂电话
Michelle, please don't hang up.

3
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,440
跟我聊聊好吗？
Just talk to me, okay?

4
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,260
我很难相信你就这样离开了
I can't believe you just left.

5
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,740
米歇尔
Michelle

6
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,000
回来吧
Come back.

7
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,510
说一下话好吗
Please say something.

8
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,460
米歇尔？跟我说说话
Michelle?  Talk to me.

9
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,790
听着，我们之前有争论，夫妻吵架
Look, we had an argument, couples fight, that is ..

10
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,490
但没有任何理由就这样撇下所有事情不管啦
No reason to just leave everything behind.

11
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,130
逃避是解决不了问题的，米歇尔，求你了
Running away isn't going to help anything. Michelle, please ..

12
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,500
今天其他消息，南方海滨许多城市仍然没有恢复供应电力
Elsewhere today, power has still not been restored to many cities on the Southern seaboard.

13
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,940
这次大范围停电是从今天下午开始的
In the wake of this afternoon's widespread blackout..

14
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,670
该地区会有狂风暴雨的袭击
There has been some inclement weather in the region,

15
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,230
看来问题是跟灾难性的天气到来有关了
Problems seem linked to what authorities are calling a catastrophic power surge.

16
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,380
该地区交通陷入一片混乱
That has crippled traffic in the area.

17
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:53,560
科洛弗道10号
10 CLOVERFIELD LANE

18
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,830
没有信号
'NO SIGNAL'

19
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,520
好的好的，求你了
Okay, ok .. please.

20
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,740
求你了
Please ..

21
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,870
求你不要伤害我
Please don't hurt me.

22
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:22,950
求你了
Please,

23
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,100
放了我吧？我发誓我不会告诉任何人的
Just let me go, okay? I won't tell anybody, I promise.

24
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,500
求你放了我吧，求你了
Please just let me go.  Please.

25
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,250
你需要打点滴
You need fluids.

26
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,070
你受了点震荡
You were in shock.

27
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,990
你要对我做什么？
What're you going to do to me?

28
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,680
我会让你生存下去
I'm going to keep you alive.

29
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,020
走路用这个会方便点
Walk on getting handy with these.

30
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,340
我的男朋友在等着我
My boyfriend was expecting me.

31
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,200
他会找警察来找我的
He'll send the cops looking.

32
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,940
很抱歉
I'm sorry ..

33
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,020
但是没有人在找你
But no one is looking for you.

34
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,960
你搞了些对抗
You got some fight in you.

35
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,710
我很欣赏
I can respect that.

36
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,030
但别想着再来一次了
But don't even think about trying that again.

37
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,820
你来到这里真的很幸运
You're lucky to be here at all.

38
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,950
我的容忍度也是...有限的
My generosity only extends .. so far.

39
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,020
鸡蛋
Eggs,

40
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,030
泰勒诺（药名）会减轻你的疼痛
Tylenol to help with your pain.

41
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:28,400
求你了，求你放了我吧
Please .. please .. just let me go.

42
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,830
求你了...没地方可以去了，米歇尔
- Please. - There's nowhere to go, Michelle.

43
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,640
这眼神看起来不错嘛
That looks pretty well.

44
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,480
鉴于这是我救了你，我认为这是可以接受的
Given it as how I saved your life, I think that's acceptable.

45
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,790
你来到这里真的很幸运
You're lucky to be here at all.

46
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,050
你什么意思？我发现了你
- What do you mean? - I found you.

47
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,880
我救了你，带你来到这里
And I saved your life, by bringing you here.

48
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,240
我不明白
I don't understand,

49
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,410
之前遭到了袭击
There's been an attack.

50
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,730
什么？
What?

51
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,500
有袭击，很大型的
An attack. A big one.

52
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,550
我不确定是化学攻击，还是核攻击
I'm not sure yet if it's chemical, or nuclear.

53
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,230
但是我们在这里是安全的
But down here we're safe.

54
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,600
我们这是在哪里？
And where are we, exactly?

55
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,520
在我农场房子的下面
Underneath my farmhouse.

56
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,470
查尔斯湖外40英里远的地方
40 miles outside of Lake Charles.

57
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:34,080
我...我在这里的北面开车。-你发生意外了
- I ..  was driving north of here. - You were in an accident.

58
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,400
你在路边翻车了，我路过看到你
You were turned over on the side of the road. I was driving by, and I saw you.

59
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,940
我救了你，米歇尔
I saved your life, Michelle.

60
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,070
我不能就那样不管你
I couldn't just leave you there.

61
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,750
非常感谢你救了我
Thank you so much, for saving my life.  I ..

62
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,280
我想，我现在应该去医院
I guess I should, I should go to a hospital, now.

63
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,840
你不能走
You can't leave.

64
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,860
因为这次的袭击
An attack means all of them.

65
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,260
地面的空气被污染了，就因为此
Which contaminates the air above ground. That's, that's how it works.

66
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,880
我们还要等多久才会安全？
How, how long do we have to wait until it's safe?

67
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,590
根据最近一次爆炸的情况，一年，可能两年吧
Depends on the proximity to the closest blast. One year, maybe two.

68
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:29,310
而且那只是我们刚说到的知道的武器
And that's if we're, we're talking about weapons that we know of.

69
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,440
俄罗斯人发明了些肮脏的武器，而如果火星人终于找到了这里来
Russians were developing some nasty stuff. And if the martians finally found a way to get here.

70
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,550
他们的武器会让我们的核武器看起来像棍子和石头一样
Their weapons will, will make our nukes look like, like sticks and stones.

71
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,230
幸运的是
Luckily,

72
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,800
我准备了这一切
I prepared for this.

73
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,040
我想借用一下你手机
I need to use your phone, then,

74
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,220
打给我家人，告诉他们我在这里很安全
To call my family. And, and tell them that I'm safe here.

75
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,930
然后确认一下他们也是安全的。-米歇尔，他们不安全
- And make sure they're okay. - Michelle, they're not okay.

76
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,190
你怎么知道？
How do you know that?

77
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,590
在外面的人全都死了
Everyone outside of here is dead.

78
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,760
你呢？你没有家人吗？
What about you? Don't you have a family?

79
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,950
没有
No

80
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,050
那是谁？
Who's that?

81
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,800
失礼一下
Excuse me.

82
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,030
你干了些什么？
What did you do?

83
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,570
等等
Wait.

84
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,750
你知道吗，米歇尔？我要跟你说，我和他说了些什么
You know what, Michelle? I'm going to tell you, what I told him..

85
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,310
你需要吃的，你需要睡觉
You need to eat, you need to sleep,

86
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,330
而且你需要对我表示一些感激
And you need to start showing me a little bit of appreciation.

87
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,980
我名字是霍华德
My name is Howard, by the way.

88
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,300
天啊，糟了
God, oh shit.

89
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,540
很对不起
I'm sorry,

90
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,980
抱歉什么。我不是故意...
Sorry about that.  I didn't mean to ..

91
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,520
吓你
Scare you.

92
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,260
你，呃，你饿吗？
You, hmm,  hmm, you hungry?

93
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,380
你还好吗？没事吧？
So how're you doing, huh?  You okay?

94
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,410
这是什么？
What is this?

95
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,870
是个仓库
It's a bunker.

96
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,510
你房间天花装的好点，但...
Your room is a bit of a fixer-upper, but ..

97
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,350
至少你还有门
At least you got the door.

98
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,910
一扇可怕的门，但你至少有门
A scary door, but you still got the door.

99
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,180
你来这里多久了？
How long have you been down here?

100
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,340
几天吧，我想。你知道，这很难说
A couple of days, I think.  You know, it's actually kind of hard to tell.

101
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,720
没有窗户、阳光，还有其他东西
No windows, the sunlight, and everything.

102
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,890
我意思是，我们怎么离开这里？
I mean, how do we get out of here?

103
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,860
他没告诉你吗？
He didn't tell you?

104
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,930
关于...
About ..

105
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,020
离开这里是你最不愿意做的事
Getting out of here, is the last thing you want to do.

106
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,530
因为外面的空气
Cause the air out there,

107
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,610
都被污染了
It's contaminated.

108
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,110
我看你遇上艾米特了
I see you've met Emmett

109
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,480
他发生什么事了？他自己干的事
- What happened to him? - He did that to himself.

110
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,280
他在这里发脾气没有任何帮助
And his stumbling around isn't helping anything.

111
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,850
你之前听到的
What you heard earlier,

112
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,090
就是他撞翻了架子，上面有一个星期的粮食
Was him knocking over a shelf with a whole week's worth of food.

113
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,340
他很过意不去的，是吧？
Which he's sorry for, correct?

114
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,660
非常
Totally.

115
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,430
走吧，上厕所时间
Let's go.  Bathroom time.

116
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,370
这是公共区域，娱乐休息用的
This is the common area.  Good for R&R.

117
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:54,690
如你所见，我已经做好打算在这常住了
As you can see, I've planned for a long stay.

118
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,490
空气净化器会净化空气保持新鲜
The applaponic system cleans the air and keeps it fresh.

119
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,190
这是起居室，你自己想看什么书都随意
This is the living room. Help yourself to any reading.

120
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,730
如果你想看电影
If you like to watch films,

121
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:07,720
我有一些DVD和录像带
I have some on DVD and VHS cassette.

122
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:11,430
不过你看完后要把它放回原位
Just make sure you put them back in their sleeve when they're done.

123
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:16,680
厨房是多功能的。有电磁炉，冰库
The kitchen is fully functional. There's an electric stove, refrigerator.

124
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,040
冰箱，银器
Freezer, silverware.

125
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,680
这张桌子是我祖辈留下的，这是说你们要看管好你们的玻璃器物
And that table is a family heirloom, which means watch your glasses.

126
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,760
都要用杯托和餐具垫
Always use coasters and placemats.

127
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,770
缩开你的手！
Keep you hands to yourself!

128
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,670
明白吗？
Understand?

129
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,780
不要触碰
No touching.

130
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,440
坐下吧
Take a seat.

131
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,120
这边来
This way.

132
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,480
这是我的私人场所
This is my private space

133
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,600
除非有我允许，禁止入内
Off-limits, unless I give express permission.

134
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,870
你进去吧
Go ahead.

135
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,020
不，我不需要。但是你会
- Nah, I don't need to. - You will though.

136
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,700
我会整理一下这里的，所以请便
And I've got to pace these things out, so please.

137
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,490
我要上厕所。-就在靠近帘子那边
- I need privacy. - You're welcome to close the curtain.

138
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,850
你站在那我上不了
I can't with you standing there.

139
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:40,280
但我不能相信你不会烧了这个地方，这关乎我个人的安全
And I can't trust you not to burn this place down. This is for my own safety.

140
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,890
我不是那些...变态。去吧
I'm not some .. pervert.  Just go.

141
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,570
你搞定之前不要冲水
Don't flush unless you've gone.

142
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,620
不要浪费水
Can't afford wasting flushes.

143
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,110
找个凳子坐吧
Take a seat.

144
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,620
你饿不饿？
Are you hungry?

145
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,740
那些是美根的书
Those are Megan's.

146
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,450
她去哪都要带上两三件这东西
She never went anywhere without two or three of those things.

147
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,660
美根是谁？
Who's Megan?

148
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,640
美根已经死了
Megan's not with us anymore.

149
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,860
别担心，发电机而已
Don't worry.  Just the generator.

150
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,300
可能是辆车在外面
Maybe it's a car outside.

151
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,560
那不可能。-我听到过一次
- That's not possible. -  I heard one earlier.

152
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,720
就在我房间头顶
Above my room.

153
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,110
如果你真的听到，那司机现在肯定已经死了很久了
If you had heard a car, the driver would be long dead by now.

154
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,050
我们不应该尝试着打电话给警察吗？
Shouldn't we at least try .. to call the police?

155
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,560
要有人查查到底发生了什么事？-没有人可以求救了
- Someone to find out what actually happened? - There's no one left to call.

156
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,200
看到没？没有东西能穿进来
See that?  Nothing's coming through.

157
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,170
你认为我是个疯子
You think I sound crazy.

158
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,180
这很让人惊讶，你们这些人
It's amazing, you people..

159
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:24,450
你们骑车时会戴头盔，开车就戴安全带
You wear helmets when you ride your bikes, you have seat-belts,

160
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,750
在家里装个警报系统来保护房子
You're in your cars, you have alarm systems to protect your homes.

161
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,790
但如果那些警报失效了，你会做什么呢？
But what do you do when those alarms go off?

162
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,710
洪水来了你才造船那才叫疯了
Crazy, is building your ark after the flood is already come.

163
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:46,110
我想现在是时候让你见见弗兰克和米尔德
I think now might be time you met Frank and Mildred.

164
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,330
这是我离空气锁最近的了
Closest I can get to in airlock.

165
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,750
看到没？
See?

166
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,810
他们发生什么事了？
What happened to them?

167
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,150
它们不像你这么幸运
They weren't as lucky as you.

168
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,220
是因为空气，米歇尔
It's the air, Michelle.

169
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,440
如果你出去了就会变成那样
That's what happens when you get exposed.

170
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,800
我把这扇门给封了，全天候的
I keep this door sealed, at all times.

171
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,040
没有人能进或出
No one comes in or out.

172
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,440
看到了弗兰克和米尔德了吧？
Met Frank and Mildred, huh?

173
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,260
这很有趣对吧？
It's funny, right?

174
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:06,900
世界末日了，但他最难过的是一对死猪
The whole world ends.  And the thing's he's most upset about is a pair of dead pigs.

175
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,330
你要看点书吗？
You gonna need some .. uh, reading material.

176
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,510
都烂成这样，不好意思
That's all there is, sorry.

177
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,590
我想学一下怎么弄个法式辫子
My idea of how to learn to do a french braid, so..

178
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,670
如果你想让我帮你扎的话，你跟我说一声
If you want me to do that for you, just let me know.

179
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,850
你知道他些什么东西？
What do you know about him?

180
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,490
他以前是海军的，我知道
He was in the Navy, I know that.

181
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,950
我想他是做卫星之类的活吧
I guess he did, uh, some stuff with satellites.

182
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,830
什么之类的活？
What kinds of stuff?

183
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,570
卫星...的东西
Satellite .. stuff.

184
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,020
那什么把他带来这的？
And what brought him out here?

185
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,940
我不知道
I'm not sure.

186
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,340
他买这房子有一段时间了
He bought this property a while back.

187
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:05,570
我从没注意过，知道他请我帮他盖好这里
I never paid much attention, until he hired me to help him get this place set up.

188
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,100
这份工，呃...
The work, was, uh..

189
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,350
蛮有趣的，这是肯定的
Entertaining, though, that's for sure.

190
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,490
你知道，霍华德阴谋论里的黑带
You know, Howard, is like a black belt in conspiracy theories.

191
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,900
而且，你知道，不会时常有人叫你建造世界末日避难所的
Plus, you know, how often do you get hired to build the doomsday bunker?

192
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,300
他，绑架你了？
He .. kidnapped you?

193
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,530
没有
No.

194
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,360
你的手臂怎么了？你是不是尝试着逃走？
What happened to your arm? You were trying to escape?

195
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,370
我是尝试着进来
I was trying to get in.

196
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,860
我看着霍华德建造这个地方，一点一点的，好多年了
And I watched Howard build this place, piece by piece, for years.

197
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,440
他经常说起些...
He was always talking about..

198
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,860
你知道，可能的袭击
you know, possible attacks,

199
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,700
阿尔盖答，俄罗斯，南韩
Al-Qeda, Russia, South Korea,

200
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,510
你指朝鲜吧？-是疯了的那个吗？
- You mean North Korea? - the, the.. is that the crazy one?

201
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,200
是的，就那个
Yeah, that one.  Hmm ..

202
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:59,270
你知道，把他所有钱都花在这上面，就像他的命就靠它了
And, hmm, you know. Pour all his money into this place, took to it, like his life depended on it.

203
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,430
你知道
Which,.. you know,

204
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,230
现在加上你了
That stays with you.

205
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,250
所以
So,

206
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,070
他告诉你这些
He told all this,

207
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,110
在你帮他建造这个避难所的时候
While you're building his bomb shelter,

208
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,990
现在他说
And now he says that ..

209
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,690
空气被污染了，全部人都死了
The air is contaminated, and everybody's dead.

210
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,520
是的，我知道你怀疑，但不止这些
Yeah, I know what you're getting at. But there's more to it.

211
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,100
霍华德绑架了我
Howard abducted me.

212
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,660
他把我撞出路边，然后把我拽来这里
He drove me off the road, and he dragged me here.

213
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,950
所以无论他告诉你些什么，空气
So whatever he's telling you about the .. air,

214
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,130
大型袭击，起避难所的目的，都是骗人的。-不，不是的
- Some big attack. The purpose of this shelter, is a lie. - No, no way.

215
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,800
那场袭击，我亲眼看到的
The attack, I saw it myself.

216
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,560
你什么意思？
What do you mean?

217
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,390
我下班途中
It's on my way from work,

218
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,130
像闪了一下
And, looked like a flash.

219
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,450
很亮的红光
Bright red,

220
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,710
像爆炸一样，很远的地方
Like an explosion, from way far off.

221
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,170
不像是烟花
Wasn't like fireworks,

222
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,280
不是的，它更像你在圣经里读到的
No, it was more this like something your read about in the bible.

223
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,670
如此你看到的是闪光？闪电？
So what you saw was a flashing light? Lightning?

224
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,700
燃尽一切的大火？-我...我也解释不清
- Fire that cleared up? - I'm not .. explaining it right.

225
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:20,880
这不像我曾经看到过的
This wasn't like anything I've ever seen.

226
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,510
这是我从没见过的
This was something I've never seen before

227
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,220
所以我直接来到这里了
So I came directly here.

228
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:29,530
当我来到这里，我只想让霍华德关上那门
When I came here, I wanted Howard just close the door.

229
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,500
我可以看得出，在他脸上，他知道发生什么了
I can see it,right there on his face, he knew something was happen.

230
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,950
一些可怕的事
Something bad.

231
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,400
所以我进来了
So I thought my way in.

232
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,950
我听到一辆车
I heard a car.

233
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,590
在我们上面
Above us.

234
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:59,140
你听到有人吗？-就在我们上面
Did you hear somebody? - Right above us.

235
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,460
那不可能
That's impossible.

236
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,990
空气...什么，被污染了？
Heaven is ... - What? Infective?

237
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:13,250
你怎么知道？-因为那是我说的
How do you know? - Because I said.

238
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,890
晚餐准备好了
The food is ready.

239
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,320
我看到你们两个相处得很好啊
I see you along.

240
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,300
果酱怎么样？
What is sauce?

241
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,340
还好吧。-说到厨艺，我还行的
It's fine. - Can I cook enough.

242
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:18,820
不是非常好，但是还可以。美根是个好厨师
Not good, but reasonable. Megan was a great cook.

243
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,470
你会学到一点烹饪技术
You will learn a little cooking.

244
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:37,550
很好吃啊。这是我吃过的最好吃的酱
Is awesome. The best I ever tasted sauce.

245
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,590
你在开玩笑吧？
Are you being funny?

246
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,170
不，我意思是
No, I mean ..

247
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,170
考虑到环境的改变，你知道
Considering the alternative, which is, you know..

248
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:48,420
被化学攻击，或者是核武器攻击后
Get burned up in a chemical attack, or nuclear ..

249
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,300
我还生存着，来到这里
I say being alive, and down here is ..

250
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,730
就算是炸便便也是非常美味的
It's made a fried turd taste pretty good, so..

251
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,690
所以是我吃过的最好的酱
Best damn sauce I ever had.

252
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,940
听起来有点道理，但请你注意一下餐桌语言
that sounds be a point, and please watch your language at the table.

253
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,700
好的
Right.

254
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:14,630
你知道我脑海中一直浮现一种东西，因为一些原因
You know what I haven't been able to get out of my head, for some reason.

255
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,440
自从我来到这里之后
Ever since I got down here,

256
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,160
纹身
Tatoos.

257
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,460
我一直想纹一个
I always wanted one.

258
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:27,100
但我从来没纹过。因为所有人都说不要啊，都说如果你纹了，就找不到一份好工作了
But I never got any.  Because everyone always said, nah, no, Emmett you'll never get a decent job if you do that.

259
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,750
管它呢
Whatever

260
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,540
看来现在可以纹了，对吧？
Like that matters now, right?

261
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,210
告诉你们，如果我知道会这样子，我早就纹它50个了
Tell you what, I had know this was coming, I'd gotten like 50 of them.

262
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,050
我就是这样
That's where I'm at.

263
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:42,120
我会看起来像个怪人，我会全身都纹遍，从头到脚趾
I would look like a circus freak or something. I would just be covered.  Head to toe, tattoos all over ..

264
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,420
全身都是，脸，衣服，就那，横过我前额
Everywhere, face, shirt, right there. Across my forehead.

265
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,840
就我的名字，艾米特
Just my name, Emmett.

266
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,550
或者，你知道
Or, you know..

267
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,480
“恶棍人生”
- "Thug Life" - [Michelle laughs]

268
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,760
YOLO
- 'YOLO'

269
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:59,880
我不知道这什么意思，但我听到别人总是说，所以这肯定是很酷的
I don't even know what that means, but, I hear people saying it all the time.  So it must be cool.

270
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,920
嘿，你呢，霍华德？
Hey, what about you, Howard?

271
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,030
你想做的都做完了吗？
Anything you wish you'd done?

272
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,780
老实说，没有
In all honesty, no.

273
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,980
没有？
No?

274
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,830
没想过去拉斯维加斯过一个疯狂的夜晚？
No crazy nights in Vegas?,

275
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,380
或者，去朝圣？
Maybe, ah, take a pilgrimage to Waco?

276
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,910
我想做的事情都做了
Everything I wanted to do, I did.

277
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,860
我只专注于准备
I focused on being prepared.

278
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,400
而我准备好了
And I was.

279
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,340
故我们才能在这里
And here we are.

280
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,480
噢，我的天啊
Oh, my goodness..

281
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,340
那是“独占”吗？
Is that Monopoly?

282
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,000
我们玩吧
There we go.

283
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,320
对了，我们可以消磨时间
Yeah, that's how we kill the time.

284
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:03,810
我意思是，你说什么来着？我们将会在这里生活一两年，还是三年？
I mean, what you say?  We're going to be down here like what, a year, two, three?

285
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,110
我打赌如果我们现在就开始玩，可能很快就可以结束了
Bet you if we started a game right now, we might even get halfway finished..

286
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,260
不要再说了
Stop talking!

287
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,360
你不必说些我们将会在这里呆多久的笑话
You don't need to make jokes about how long we're going to be down here.

288
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,710
没人知道我们将会呆多久
When nobody knows how long that's going to be.

289
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,250
你的笑话并不好笑
You humor is not funny.

290
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:30,130
我在吃东西的时候我不想你这样做，米歇尔也不想
I don't appreciate it while I'm trying to eat, and neither does Michelle.

291
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:33,310
现在请你闭嘴吧，让我们安静的吃
Now please shut up, and let us eat in peace.

292
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,010
艾米特？
Emmett?

293
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,880
帮我递张餐巾
Pass me a napkin.

294
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,530
我知道你所说的
I know what you're saying.

295
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,330
我从来没玩完过“独占”
I never could finish Monopoly.

296
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,160
那游戏没有终结的，是吧？
That game really does take forever, right?

297
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,800
对我来说，它是
For me though, it was .. hmm,

298
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,740
“斜坡和梯子”
'Chutes, and Ladders'.  Ahmm,

299
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,800
“抱歉”
'Sorry',

300
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,520
和“麻烦”
and 'Trouble'.

301
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:36,390
那有着骰子，你按着的那东西，叫什么来着？
And that thing with the dice, and that thing that you press, what is that called?

302
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,710
那是...“珀珀泡泡”，对对，没错
That,  that .. 'PoppleMatic Bubble!', yeah, right!

303
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,490
你曾经玩过“行动”吗？
You ever play that, what was it, 'Operation'?

304
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,320
噢，“行动”啊。-噢，我不能玩那游戏
- Oh 'Operation" - Oh, man, I couldn't play that game.

305
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:49,560
当你敲打边边的时候发出的噪音
That noise that thing would make when you hit that edge, when..

306
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,380
天啊。-那真够吓人的
- Good lord, - That was scary.

307
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,910
麻烦你递一下盐给我
Can you give me the salt?

308
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,090
请
Please?

309
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,700
啊，不好意思
Ah, shoot.  Sorry.

310
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,250
我还想要胡椒粉
I'm going to need the pepper also,

311
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,580
你想要干嘛？-我只想要胡椒粉而已
- What exactly do you think you're doing? - I'm just asking for the pepper.

312
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:22,380
去你的，那是什么东西？-我不知道你在说什么
- The hell you were?  What was that? - I don't know what you're talking about.

313
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,600
你是在侮辱我吗？
You trying to insult me?

314
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:28,780
在这个我建造的让你活下去的避难所里？
Here in a shelter that I built, that's keeping you alive?

315
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,820
你以为我看不到你所做的吗？
You don't think I see what you just did?

316
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,140
这就是我救了你的回报？
Is that how you thank me for saving your life?

317
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,820
冷静点-闭嘴
- Calm down. - Shut Up!

318
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,130
闭嘴！坐下来！
Shut Up!  And stay in your seat!

319
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:46,550
是这样吗？
Is it?

320
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,970
我告诉你吧
Let me tell you,

321
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,140
我知道背叛者是什么样子的
I know what a traitor looks like,

322
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,490
明白吗？
Understand?

323
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:00,320
我一直对你慷慨和大度
I have shown you nothing but generosity, and hospitality.

324
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,730
我要你道歉
I want you to apologize.

325
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,850
告诉我你会守规矩
And tell me you're going to behave.

326
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:12,890
我会
I will.

327
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,450
你会什么
You will what?

328
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,280
我会守规矩
I'll behave.

329
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,120
还有，我很抱歉
And I'm so sorry.

330
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,270
你必须保持头脑清醒
You have to stay hydrated.

331
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,260
在这里老容易忘记
It's easy to forget down here.

332
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:16,700
有什么问题吗
What's wrong?

333
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,060
没有
Nothing

334
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,950
我的钥匙呢？
Where are my keys?

335
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,320
米歇尔
Michelle!

336
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,680
停下
Stop!

337
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,400
把钥匙给我
Give me those keys!

338
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,970
开啊开啊-我要走啦
- Come on. - I'm going.

339
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,210
不不！
No! No!

340
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,660
不要！不要打开！
No! Don't do it!

341
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,630
不要！
No!

342
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,140
不要打开门！
Don't open that door!

343
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,880
那是辆车！
It's a car!

344
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,810
那是辆车！我看到一辆车！
It's a car!  I see a car!

345
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,560
这里！这里！
Here!  Here!

346
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,710
这里！
Here!

347
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,410
米歇尔！听我说，不要打开！
Michelle, listen to me, don't do it!

348
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,780
救命啊！
Help me!

349
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,140
有个女人-打开门
- There's a woman. - Open the door.

350
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:58,160
我只是想进来-她看起来受伤了，她想让我进来
- I just.. I want to come inside. - She looks hurt, she wants me to let her in!

351
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,630
不要让她进来
Do not let her in!

352
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,400
看看她的脸，米歇尔！
Look at her face, Michelle!

353
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,740
不要，不不不不
No, no, no .. no, no.

354
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,310
天啊 我没事
oh my god, I'm fine..

355
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,070
真的 我没事
I am really, I'm fine. I am ok.

356
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:18,950
我只是感染了一点点 开门 拜托
Just a little, oh , please open the door.

357
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,980
开门 她在求我
- Open it. - She's begging me!

358
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,690
你帮了不她
You can't help her!

359
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:26,190
没人可以 会没事的 我很好
- Nobody can. - It'll be okay.

360
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:30,130
我会没事的，我们都会
I'll be okay, all of us.

361
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,610
开门啊
Open the door!

362
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:33,800
不要听她的
Don't listen to her!

363
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:36,500
开门 婊子
Open the door, you bitch!

364
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,830
让我进去
Let me in!

365
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,840
让我进去!让我进去!让我进去!
Let me in!   Let me in!   Let me in!

366
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,680
快点！
Now!

367
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:50,180
快点快点！
Now.  Now!

368
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,210
快点！
Now!

369
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,450
开门
Open!

370
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:24,110
我知道这很难以接受
I know it's hard.

371
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,830
意识到他们都死掉了
Realizing they're all gone.

372
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,730
你爱的人
The ones you love.

373
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,310
我有些事要向你坦白
I have something to confess to you.

374
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,630
我撞了你的车
I crashed into your car.

375
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,980
你的事故
Your accident.

376
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,860
是我造成的
Was my fault.

377
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:59,620
当我知道袭击就要发生的时候 我发狂了
When I found out about the incoming attack, I got frantic.

378
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,690
我知道我要尽快回到这里
I knew I needed to get back here as soon as possible,

379
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:05,120
所以我开得像疯子一样
Oh, I was driving like a maniac,

380
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,500
我想要超你车
I tried to pass you, and..

381
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:17,100
车祸是我造成的
I'm the reason you went off the road.

382
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,940
我知道我看起来是一个理智的人
And I know I seem like a sensible guy,

383
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:25,400
但在那时候，我不是我
But, at the time, I wasn't myself.

384
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:30,580
那的确是个意外 但是是我的错
It was an accident.  But it was my fault.

385
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,870
我不敢告诉你
I was afraid to tell you.

386
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,690
对不起
I'm sorry.

387
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,040
你该洗个澡了
You should shower,

388
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:56,550
缝隙里进来的一点点空气都可能有毒
You had the smallest amount of air that came through the hinges, could be toxic.

389
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,260
这些是美根的衣服
These are Megan's.

390
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:03,000
如果你想穿的话
If you want them.

391
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:09,810
我认得出那女人的车
I recognize that woman's car.

392
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:12,920
她叫莱斯利，我记得
Her name was Leslie, I think.

393
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,080
你认识她？
You knew her?

394
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,100
是个邻居
She was a neighbor.

395
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,130
艾米特不是唯一一个知道这里的人
Emmett wasn't the only one that knew about this place.

396
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:26,870
如果有其他幸存者 他们可能也会来这里
If any others somehow survived, they could be coming here too.

397
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,440
星期五，善良和大方都是过时的
As of Friday, kindness and generosity are antiquated customs.

398
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:43,390
我需要缝针
I'm going to need some stitches.

399
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,770
你要我帮你？
Why, you want me to..?

400
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:56,700
这是你干的好事，对吧？
This is your doing, isn't it?

401
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:59,410
我意思是我怕我做不来
I mean, I don't think I'm really qualified.

402
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:00,860
我会教你的
I'll walk you through it.

403
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,240
过来
Here.

404
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,270
喝一口
Have a drink.

405
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,400
是什么？
What is it?

406
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,830
学术上说是
Technically, it's ..

407
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,260
伏特加
Vodka

408
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,480
没有毒 我自己酿的了
Safe.  I distill it myself.

409
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,750
我只是说这酒是我自己酿的，但我不保证味道
- I just said I distill it, I didn't say anything about it tasting good.
408
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,750
嗯，这就真难喝
Yeah, that's awful.

410
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:41,190
你冰一下，会好喝点的
You want it on the rocks.

411
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:50,220
我年轻的时候驻扎在船上 没什么事 研究的这个小技巧
Little trick I taught myself as a young man stationed on a ship, with way too much free time.

412
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:55,300
有时候 指挥官安排的人物太多 我会冰上一两杯偷偷的喝
Every now and again, if the CO was working us too hard. We'd freeze and snap the knob off..

413
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:57,720
然后把浴室把手敲坏 里面还有人的
the bathroom door while they were still inside.

414
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,960
那要一两个小时才能出来吧
I guess it took an hour or two, to get out

415
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,740
够了
I'm good.

416
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:07,440
那你自便 我喝了
Suit yourself.  Cheers.

417
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,070
这很干净
This is clean.

418
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:20,750
你只管缝针就是了
All you need to do is .. stitch.

419
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:44,760
真有两下子
You're doing fine.

420
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:50,840
这是从你车上拿出来的
Stuff I grabbed from your car.

421
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,270
估计是还没来得及用
Didn't have time to bring in the booze.

422
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,020
这很遗憾
Sadly.

423
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,500
全都在这吗？
What is all that?

424
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,350
我想做服装设计
I wanted to design clothes.

425
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:07,540
怪不得你针线活那么好
No wonder you were so good with the stiches.

426
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:11,820
美根想做艺术家
Megan wanted to be an artist.

427
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:16,130
- 她是你女儿吗？ - 嗯
- She was your daughter? - Yeah

428
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:28,980
她很聪明 喜欢看书 看杂志 有时候看书是为了放松心情
She was smart, loved to read, the magazines or just for fun.

429
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:32,060
她喜欢关于巴黎的书
She inhaled books. Anything with Paris.

430
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,190
她喜欢那里的电影和文化
She liked their movies. Their culture, you know.

431
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,130
有时候我跟她开玩笑，我问她
We used to have this little joke, every once in a while, I'd ask her..

432
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:41,330
你长大后要做什么？
What do you want to be when you grow up?

433
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,330
你猜她怎么回答？
And you know what she'd say?

434
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:47,440
她说要做法国人
French.

435
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,280
不管怎么样
Anyway,

436
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,190
她妈妈还是带她离开了
Her mother turned her against me.

437
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:55,030
她们去了芝加哥
Took her off to Chicago.

438
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:58,850
人类真是奇怪的生物
People are strange creatures

439
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:02,980
不管怎么说都不听 他们不知道外面的世界有多危险
You can't always convince them that safety is in their own  best interest

440
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,010
你知道吗 都过去了
You don't know they're gone.

441
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:10,980
不管怎样
Anyway,

442
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,440
至少我帮过她们
At least I tried to help them.

443
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:28,250
嘿，知道吗 无论你怎么做 那女人都活不了
Hey, you know there is nothing you could've done for that woman

444
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:32,320
就算是你带她进来了 她还是会死的
Even if you had let her in, she still would've died.

445
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,820
你是后悔了吗
You asked earlier about .. regrets,

446
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,950
我有点后悔了
Yeah, I got some of those.

447
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,740
我们俩总算想一块了
Welcome to the club.

448
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:02,120
我是说 我生活在一个小圈子里
I mean, I lived my life in a 40-mile radius.

449
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,820
但 我跟肯定 一切都是天意
And that was by design, I made sure that happened.

450
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,570
高中时我很能跑
I was so fast in high school,

451
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:13,720
但成绩却差得很
I even managed to outrun my bad grades.

452
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:20,310
我曾经是州代表运动员
I was all-state track,

453
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,200
而且是连续三年
Three years in a row.

454
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:27,230
我拿过路易斯安娜理工大学的全额奖学金
Caught a full ride to Louisiana Tech up there in Ruston.

455
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:34,560
我记得 输家的最后两个星期里
I remember I spent the last two weeks of that summer,

456
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:39,220
我向别人炫耀学校寄给我的共车票 只要想看 都可以看的
Showing off the bus ticket they sent me, to anybody who looked at it

457
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:43,910
去学校的前一晚
And then came the night before I was supposed to leave,

458
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,620
我很担心
And I just got so worried,

459
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:55,310
我不知道到了那里要干嘛
About how bad I was going to do up there

460
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:57,760
毕竟那里人才辈出
With all those smart kids

461
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,280
所以我堕落了
So I went out of my way

462
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,720
整天喝酒 喝到不省人事
To get just pissed wasted, so bad that

463
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,610
每天早上都起不来床
There was no chance I was waking up in in the morning.

464
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:15,400
所以 我就搭不上巴士
So I missed the bus

465
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,810
赶不上第一班 下一班也就不搭了
I didn't buy a ticket for the next one

466
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,640
在下一班也一样
Or the one after that.

467
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,280
如果你搭上了 你可能已经死掉了
Well, if you'd gone, you might be dead now.

468
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,020
是啊 我很幸运 对吧
Well, lucky me, right?

469
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,530
我们都一样幸运
Lucky us.

470
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,280
几年前
A few, a few years ago,

471
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,330
我还住在五金店里
I was at a hardware store

472
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:49,950
那时 店里来了个男的 带着他女儿
And there was this little girl, with her Dad.

473
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,800
那男的走的快 小女孩跟不上
And he was in a hurry, and she wasn't keeping up.

474
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,360
于是
and he kept

475
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:02,150
那男的就很恨的拽着小女孩的胳膊 拖着她走
yanking on her arm, really hard, you know.

476
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,030
太过分了
too hard.

477
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:10,970
你知道那是什么感觉吗？
You know that feeling?

478
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:19,530
当我爸爸想拽我手的时候 我哥哥科林总是在我身边
When my Dad got that way, my brother Collin was always there.

479
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:22,880
还拼命的挖苦我 好让爸爸拽我
To take the worst of it. For me.

480
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,960
看到那个小女孩后 我想 也许我可以
And after seeing that little girl, I thought maybe I could

481
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,860
帮一下
do that

482
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,860
那个女孩
For her.

483
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,190
可是 我只是眼睁睁的看着她
But I just kept watching

484
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:44,330
他们要离开的时候 我还是什么都没做
And they were about to leave, and I'd done nothing.

485
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:48,470
但是
And,

486
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:50,720
小女孩溜出去了
she slips

487
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:54,260
那男的很生气 于是就打小女该
And it throws him out off-balance and he hits her

488
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:59,210
我很想帮那个小女孩
And I wanted so badly to do something.

489
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,290
帮她脱困 但
To help her, but

490
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,330
每当遇到困难时
I do what I always do when things get hard

491
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:09,130
我都会逃避
I just panicked and ran.

492
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:15,470
听着
Look,

493
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:18,820
我们还在这 我们还活着
We're here, we're alive.

494
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:21,980
只要还活着就好
And that means something.

495
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,590
懂了吗？
got it?

496
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:01,110
有没有搞错
You've got to be kidding me.

497
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:02,210
什么？
What?

498
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:04,290
这里缺了几块
We're missing pieces here.

499
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,870
看着可怜的小猫
Look at this poor cat.

500
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:09,680
都变畸形猫了 成独眼猫了
He's been deformed, he's got one eye.

501
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:13,040
这猫还要潜水呢 就是少了一只眼睛
About to go snorkling and everything too.

502
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,570
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

503
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:25,530
喔 世界末日的时尚  呵呵
Ooh, cornering the market on post-apocalyptic fashion, huh?

504
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:28,740
我需要更多斧头和锯
Needs more axes and chainsaws.

505
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:30,120
做什么用 她有枪
For what, she has a shotgun.

506
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:32,220
是 但要是在那儿的话 就...
Yeah, what if up there it's like..

507
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,800
- 有踪迹吗？ - 笨蛋
-  tracks? - Zombies.

508
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,970
连霍华德都不认为 那是有可能的
Though even Howard doesn't think that one's possible.

509
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,030
你真应该听听他的关于突变空间蠕虫的理论
Though you should hear his theory about mutant space-worms.

510
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,390
那是什么？霍华德？
What is that? Howard?

511
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,410
保持镇定 我们很安全
Stay calm. We're okay.

512
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,910
那是什么？ - 安静
- What was that? - Quiet.

513
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,130
听起来像是直升飞机
That sounds like helicopters.

514
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:11,160
也许是部队的 但不是我们的
Could be military. But not ours.

515
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,380
你怎么能确定？
How can you tell?

516
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:16,260
- 我当了14年的海军 - 那里发生了什么事？
- 14 years in the Navy. - What's happening up there?

517
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,920
我猜 那些光已经笼罩了这里
My guess, those flashes that kicked this all off,

518
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:24,240
那只是第一阶段
That was phase 1.

519
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:28,800
往敌方集中区域攻击 强火力攻击 马上
Take out your opponent's population centers, with big hits, all at once

520
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,870
快点 继续第二轮
Fast. And then for round 2.

521
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:34,800
扫射
Ground sweeps.

522
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,880
最近的卫星记录显示编码的流通量有所增加
The satellite log shows an increase in coded traffic recently.

523
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,580
可能是外星信号吧
Possibly extra-terrestrial signals.

524
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:46,010
我想我们刚刚听到的声音是空中巡逻队
I bet what we just heard were air-borne patrols sent to hunt down

525
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:49,940
在搜寻像我们这样残存的生命
the remaining signs of life. Like us.

526
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,640
也许吧 兄弟
Okay, oh boy..

527
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,070
那就糟了
That's bad.

528
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:07,330
更糟糕的是
And that's worse.

529
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,710
那边有什么吗？
What was up there?

530
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,460
空气过滤系统
Air filtration system.

531
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,270
我够不到它 有什么东西挡住了
I can't.. something is blocking the hedge.

532
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:23,260
如果我们不能把它拿回来，我们很快就会用完空气中的氧气
If we can't get it back up, we're gonna run out of breathable air fast.

533
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:33,730
你是唯一一个能拿到的人
You're the only one small enough to reach it.

534
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,530
拿到什么？
Reach what?

535
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:38,340
空气过滤器 通过这根主管道
The filtration system. Through there, the main duct.

536
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,370
得有人去那里  然后开启他
Someone needs to get in there and re-start it.

537
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:46,460
帮我个忙
Give me a hand.

538
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:51,410
- 让我去把 - 你不合适 搭把手 她会没事的
- Let me go in,- You won't fit, plus your arm. She'll be fine.

539
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:58,490
现在 重启系统 你只需要来回的转动手柄
Now, to re-start the unit, you just swing the handle off and on. Off and on.

540
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,250
像这样
That should do it.

541
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:07,300
如果你被卡住了 我们没有办法进去帮你
And neither of us will be able to go in and help you if you get stuck.

542
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,640
别卡住了
Don't get stuck.

543
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:54,930
米歇尔？
Michelle?

544
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:57,380
一切还好吗？
Everything okay up there?

545
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,610
像个死胡同
Looks like a dead end.

546
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,290
那是斜的
That's the incline.

547
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:05,460
翻过它 差不多就到了
Climb up that, and you're almost there.

548
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,250
噢，该死的
Oh, this sucks.

549
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:54,130
救命
'HELP'

550
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:22,630
发生什么事了？
What's wrong?

551
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:28,180
他骗了你 他骗了梅甘
He lied to you, he lied about Megan.

552
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:30,880
你什么意思？
What do you mean?

553
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,280
我觉得他对她做了什么
I think he did something horrible to her.

554
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,200
怎么可能？
How?.

555
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:38,990
他的家人在很多年前已经搬去芝加哥了
His family moved to Chicago years ago.

556
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:42,890
这是什么？
What's this?

557
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,410
这是血吗？
Is that blood?

558
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,700
跟我来
Come with me.

559
01:01:58,690 --> 01:01:59,700
等等 这是..
Wait, is that..

561
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,760
都上新闻了 所有人都以为她只是离开了
It was on the news and everything. Most people just thought she skipped town.

999
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,760
她失踪了 两年后又回来了
She went missing, two years back.

1000
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,760
我这有条信息
There is a message up there.

562
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:25,350
在玻璃窗上用血写着 “救命”
It said 'HELP'. It was scratched on the inside of the window.

563
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,190
还有一只耳环
This earring was with it.

564
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,480
在她失踪后 有没有再出现过
Did she ever show up, after she went missing?

565
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:39,800
他对我说 他当着我面说 他说这是他女儿
He said to me, he said to my face. He said this is his daughter, he said this...

566
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:09,030
他带走她并杀了她
He took her and he killed her.

567
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:18,030
我以为
I was just thinking,

568
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,150
也许我们
Maybe we

569
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,600
把他的枪带走
take away his gun

570
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:26,760
把他绑起来 去坦白他做的罪行 - 什么 向谁坦白 警察吗？
Tie him up, to confess. Whatever it is he's done - What confess to who, the police?

571
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,760
看 正如我说的
Look, like I said,

572
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,710
我们不可能是唯一的幸存者 对吗？
We can't be the only survivors, right?

573
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:37,720
- 这个女人 师徒走的更远一些 对吗？ - 是的 直到死去
- The woman, she was able to get around a little, right? -- Yeah, till she died.

574
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,740
在我们正上方 窒息而死
Directly above us, choking to death.

575
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,360
还有其他人活下来吗
Other people to save

576
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:45,900
现在 那是团队工作的好榜样
Now, that's a great example of teamwork.

577
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:49,570
完成的很好 就像一些音乐
Very well done. Feel like some music.

578
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:54,280
解决问题总汇让我产生一种音乐的感觉
Problem solving always puts me in a musical mood.

579
01:03:58,770 --> 01:03:59,890
米歇尔
Michelle,

580
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:02,270
你应该洗个澡 以防万一
You should go shower, just in case.

581
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:06,340
好的
Sure

582
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:47,360
我想我有个主意
I think I might have an idea.

583
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:55,420
- 十条设计刘海的好办法 - 不 不是文章 是这个
- '10 Better Ways to Style My Bangs'? - No, not the article.  This.

584
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:58,060
我想我可以做一个
I think I can only make one.

585
01:04:58,370 --> 01:04:59,730
但那只是个开始
But it's a start.

586
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:00,790
不是开玩笑的
No kidding.

587
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:09,890
嘿 霍华德
Hey, Howard

588
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,500
这是什么 你再看 16根蜡烛 吗
What is this? You're re-watching '16 Candles'?

589
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,280
粉红色更漂亮
'Pretty in Pink'

590
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:19,180
这是梅甘最喜欢的电影  我能帮你什么吗？
It was one of Megan's favorite movies. Can I help you with something?

591
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:22,710
不 不用了 我只是在弄一些水
No, no, I'm just grabbing some water.

592
01:05:57,010 --> 01:05:58,070
说 呃
Say, ahmm,

593
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:01,660
你知道 我只是在想
You know, I was just thinking..

594
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,980
不是 我试着告诉你如何操作这个地方
Not, that I'm trying to tell you how to run this place.

595
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:07,810
但是 我只是
But I am just,

596
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:10,060
有点担心
a bit curious

597
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:13,260
米歇尔
about Michelle

598
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:17,620
你觉得她能到达离空气过滤系统多远的地方
Say, how close do you think she got to the air filtration unit?

599
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:19,200
你觉得她已经拿到它了吗？
You think she touched it?

600
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,500
是的 我非常确定她碰过了
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she touched it.

601
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:28,470
是 我知道她后来还清理了所有的事 ... 但我只是觉得
Yeah, I know she cleaned up after, and everything.. But I'm just thinking..

602
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:32,600
假如那个净化装置不知道被外界怎么样了
Given that unit filter has got god knows what from outside

603
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:37,250
如果他追踪所有的事情 那将是非常集中精神
If she tracked anything back in with her. It would be pretty concentrated

604
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:38,520
而且

605
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:42,830
会弄得 淋浴 水槽 卫生间哪里都是
Could be all over the shower, and the sink, bathroom, right now.

606

不管怎样 这只是一个假设
Well, anyways, it's just a thought.

607

目前都很好 伙计
Not bad so far, partner.

608

如果霍华德找到这个 他会杀了我们的
If Howard find this, he's going to kill us.

609
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,690
好吧 所以 我们把他的枪拿走
Alright, so, we get the gun away from him,

610
01:08:29,070 --> 01:08:31,590
把他绑起来 确定他不能到处乱走
Tie him up, make sure he isn't going anywhere.

01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:20,710
跟他没有关系 都是我一个人干的
Alright, not her, It was just me.

683
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,290
-不不 - 跟你没关系 她说的那些话是
- No, no -- Stay out of this. She doesn't have a clue

684
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,390
无稽之谈
what she's talking about.

685
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,630
我那时候想要抢
I wanted your gun.

686
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:30,020
所以我就
And so I was,

687
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:32,970
想着弄一个武器
Thinking about making a weapon

从你那里

690

我想让她像尊敬你一样尊敬我
I want her to respect me, the way she respects you.

691
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:52,880
我不是说我是对的

692
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:55,620
并且我很抱歉
And I'm sorry.

693
01:15:00,410 --> 01:15:02,760
-你很抱歉 - 我很抱歉
- You're sorry? - I am sorry.

694
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:07,670
我接受你的道歉
I accept your apology.

695
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:27,850
他当时要伤害咱们 伤害你

696
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:29,790
没事 没什么大不了的
It's okay, this is okay.

697

这是 事情原来的样子
This is the way it was always supposed to be.

698

你现在安全了

现在只有你和我
Now, it's just you and me.

700
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:37,830
没关系
It's okay.

701
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:41,560
现在 回到你的房间去 立刻
Now, you should go to your room now.

702
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:45,170
这不是你该看的东西

草，该死
Oh, shit.

728
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,240
你要从我身上踏过去,才能出去
You're going to walk out on me?

729
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:16,870
在我救了你之后
After I saved you?

730

你不知道外面有什么

你逃不掉的
