德州长子 前情提要
Previously on AMC's "The Son"...

2
00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:05,609
骑马去加西亚牧场找人帮忙
Ride to the García Ranch and get some help.

3
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:08,412
- 这是什么 - 你骑过了渗油的地方
- What is it? - You rode through an oil seep.

4
00:00:08,414 --> 00:00:10,581
皮特 你变了
Something's changed in you, Pete.

5
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:12,349
我们不能再这样生活了
We can't live like this.

6
00:00:12,351 --> 00:00:14,279
你在城市里开心吗
Are you happy here in the city?

7
00:00:14,282 --> 00:00:16,220
那你和孩子们应该留下来
Then you and the kids should stay.

8
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:18,231
我的丈夫没死
My husband didn't die.

9
00:00:18,234 --> 00:00:21,825
我对每个人都这样撒谎 但我不想对你说谎
It's a lie I told everyone, but I don't want to lie to you.

10
00:00:21,827 --> 00:00:24,171
今晚我会去你的帐篷
I'll come to your teepee tonight.

11
00:00:25,431 --> 00:00:27,464
见鬼 看看它们
Damn. Look at 'em all.

12
00:00:40,846 --> 00:00:43,914
我没想到会和你发生关系
I didn't mean for that to happen.

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,584
我不是为了这事来的
That's not why I came over.

14
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:48,485
没关系的
I didn't think that.

15
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:49,486
我得走了
I need to go.

16
00:00:49,522 --> 00:00:51,221
别
No, hey.

17
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,860
留下
Stay.

18
00:00:56,896 --> 00:00:59,930
皮特 我不应该在这儿
I have no business being here, Peter.

19
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:04,902
你是已婚的人
You're married.

20
00:01:04,937 --> 00:01:07,338
我和萨莉结束了
Sally and I are over.

21
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:09,273
我们之间没有牵连了
There's nothing left between us.

22
00:01:11,644 --> 00:01:13,544
之前你也说过类似的话
I've heard this kind of talk before.

23
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:17,047
我认真的 这次不同
I mean it. Th... This is different.

24
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:19,750
我发誓
I promise.

25
00:01:19,785 --> 00:01:21,852
留下吧
Stay.

26
00:01:21,887 --> 00:01:24,788
这儿吗 留在你家吗
Here? In your house?

27
00:01:24,824 --> 00:01:27,691
我让佣人们休假了
I gave the help the day off.

28
00:01:27,727 --> 00:01:30,361
我不想像以前一样偷偷摸摸的了
I'm not sneaking around like we used to.

29
00:01:30,396 --> 00:01:32,129
过了那个年纪了
I'm just too old for it.

30
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:34,031
和我一起吃晚饭吧
Just have dinner with me.

31
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:35,899
- 让我解释 - 解释什么
- Let me explain. - Explain what?

32
00:01:35,935 --> 00:01:39,303
都行 你想听什么我就说什么
Anything. Anything you need explained.

33
00:04:30,078 --> 00:04:31,578
我给他讲了
So, I told him,

34
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:34,080
"伙计 如果你想让我给你服务
"Amigo, if you want me to put my finger there,

35
00:04:34,115 --> 00:04:35,915
先得娶了我"
you'll need to put a ring on it first."

36
00:04:37,085 --> 00:04:38,685
他怎么回答
What'd he say to that?

37
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,054
他脸马上红了 说要给我双倍的钱
He turned bright red and offered to pay me double.

38
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:43,022
干得好
Oh! Well done, my girl.

39
00:04:43,058 --> 00:04:44,691
那你收下钱了吗
So, did you take the money?

40
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:47,927
你以为呢 跟牌加注
Oh, what do you think? Call and raise.

41
00:04:47,963 --> 00:04:50,697
下午好 姑娘们
Good afternoon, my soiled doves.

42
00:04:50,732 --> 00:04:51,965
"妈妈" 下午好
Afternoon, Mama.

43
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,466
有人想出门走走吗
Anybody feel like a bit of travel?

44
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,735
别再去什么联谊会了
Mm. No more Aggie parties.

45
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,337
大学里那帮小崽子
Them college boys wouldn't know gratuity

46
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,805
只知道掏鸟不知道掏钱
if it bit them on the pecker.

47
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,407
不 这回可都是达官贵人
No, this is a high-born affair...

48
00:05:01,443 --> 00:05:04,444
撒迪厄斯·基尔伯恩筹办了一次甜蜜狩猎
One of Thaddeus Kilborne's Honey Hunts.

49
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,213
数不完的农场主和石油大亨
Wall-to-wall ranchers and oil men,

50
00:05:07,248 --> 00:05:10,717
帕提罗·希金斯 查普曼父子和比尔·斯特林
Pattillo Higgins, the Chapmans, Bill Sterling.

51
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:14,921
听说伊莱·麦卡洛上校本人
And rumor has it that Colonel Eli McCullough, himself,

52
00:05:14,956 --> 00:05:16,489
也会露面
is gonna put in an appearance.

53
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,291
太好了
Well, la-di-da.

54
00:05:18,326 --> 00:05:21,661
基尔伯恩通知每个招待所了
Kilborne put the word out to all the boarding houses.

55
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,129
有人感兴趣吗
Anybody interested?

56
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:26,265
我去
I'll go.

57
00:05:26,301 --> 00:05:27,934
莉娜去了 还有吗
Lena's in. Anybody else?

58
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:29,302
不 谢了
Oh, no, thank you.

59
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:31,471
上次我被螨虫咬了
Last time I got my ass bit by chiggers.

60
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:34,474
有人吗
Anybody?

61
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:36,943
积极点吧
Oh, come on, gals.

62
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:39,245
说不定讨个有钱的老公
You might catch yourself a rich husband.

63
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,180
或者男人染上莉娜的水泡
Or he might catch Lena's social blisters.

64
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,184
他要是这样算走运了
He'd be a lucky fella if that's all he gets.

65
00:06:01,369 --> 00:06:03,870
米格尔 交给你了
There you go, Miguel. You know what to do.

66
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,104
谢谢
Thank you.

67
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,140
菲尼
Finn!

68
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:09,842
儿子 真高兴 你总算来了
Good to see ya, boy! Oh, glad you could make it.

69
00:06:09,878 --> 00:06:12,478
不想错过 这儿设置齐全
Oh, wouldn't miss it. It's quite a setup here.

70
00:06:12,514 --> 00:06:14,681
那确实
Well, it is that.

71
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:18,317
基尔伯恩的老爹是个炒房客
Kilborne's daddy was a property speculator.

72
00:06:18,353 --> 00:06:20,787
他的钱说不定都是靠卖烂房给别人来的
Made all his money selling bad lots to settlers.

73
00:06:20,822 --> 00:06:22,221
那些人什么毛病啊
What was wrong with them?

74
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,290
那些房子刚刚好就在
Well, it just happened it was smack in the middle

75
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:25,925
科曼切人的地界儿上
of Comanche territory.

76
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,394
看来历史的细节被人遗忘了
It looks like history's forgotten the details.

77
00:06:28,396 --> 00:06:29,729
总是这样
Well, it always does.

78
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:31,064
这片地还不错 不是吗
It's a nice spread, though, isn't it?

79
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,500
可以吗
May I?

80
00:06:34,536 --> 00:06:35,835
麦卡洛上校
Colonel McCullough?

81
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,370
请随意
Of course. Be my guest.

82
00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:48,214
百发百中啊
That was a hell of a shot!

83
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:49,882
上校
Colonel?

84
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:51,417
那是我的弓
That's my bow.

85
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:52,685
是啊
Indeed it is.

86
00:06:52,721 --> 00:06:54,987
- 吃了吗 - 没 饿坏了
- Have you eaten? - Nah, famished.

87
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:58,758
来得正好 正是吃午饭的时候
Good. You're just in time for lunch.

88
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,397
上校
Colonel!

89
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,035
撒迪厄斯·基尔伯恩法官
Ah, Judge Thaddeus Kilborne.

90
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,370
真感谢你筹办了这么个盛会
A laudable affair you've put together here.

91
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:13,039
别客气
My pleasure.

92
00:07:13,074 --> 00:07:16,375
这位是你常提起的令郎 皮特是吗
Is this your boy I heard so much about? Pete?

93
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:18,911
我是另一个 菲尼亚斯
I'm the other one. Phineas.

94
00:07:18,947 --> 00:07:19,927
很荣幸 法官大人
It's a pleasure, Your Honor.

95
00:07:19,927 --> 00:07:21,080
叫我撒迪厄斯就好
Oh, call me Thaddeus.

96
00:07:21,116 --> 00:07:23,282
我十分希望你能留下来
I do hope you plan to stick around

97
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,817
参加今晚的甜蜜狩猎
for the Honey Hunt tonight.

98
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:27,420
- 额... - 我们不会错过的
- Well... - Wouldn't miss it for the world.

99
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,590
他的弟弟结婚了 
His brother's married, but this one here,

100
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,225
但这个是出了名的花花公子
he's a legendary cocksman.

101
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:35,695
父亲真是过奖了
Well, my daddy exaggerates my exploits.

102
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,797
好小子 有主见
Oh, attaboy. Admit to nothing.

103
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:40,733
- 上校 - 撒迪厄斯
- Colonel. - Thaddeus.

104
00:07:43,102 --> 00:07:44,502
但愿有这个必要
I suppose that was necessary.

105
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,708
小心不出大错
Better safe than sorry.

106
00:07:48,743 --> 00:07:51,210
我也不是讨厌圣安东尼奥来的这群酒鬼
Not that I don't love the drunk assholes of San Antone,

107
00:07:51,246 --> 00:07:53,579
但是你把我叫来干嘛
but why did you call me here?

108
00:07:53,615 --> 00:07:55,648
祸不单行
Misery loves company.

109
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,117
不 说真的 怎么了
No, really. Why'd you call?

110
00:07:58,153 --> 00:08:01,053
我发现一处渗油点
I found an oil seep.

111
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:03,790
检测表明
Had it tested.

112
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:05,324
是低硫原油
Sweet crude.

113
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,730
那你有什么顾虑呢
So, what's the problem?

114
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:13,499
它在佩德罗·加西亚的地盘上
It's on Pedro García's land.

115
00:08:16,771 --> 00:08:18,137
他知道么
Does he know?

116
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:20,873
我想最好还是别声张
Well, I thought it best to keep it under my hat.

117
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,430
好吧 有什么计划
All right, well, what's the plan?

118
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,281
按照麦金尼家族那样
Same thing the McKinneys did.

119
00:08:28,316 --> 00:08:30,249
按照常人的做法
Same thing everybody does.

120
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:31,784
谢谢
Thank you.

121
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,121
但是佩德罗不是那些脏兮兮的文盲农民
Yeah, but Pedro's not some illiterate dirt farmer.

122
00:08:35,156 --> 00:08:36,489
他会反抗 战胜我们
He'll contest it, and he'll win.

123
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:38,524
除非他死了
Not if he's gone.

124
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,330
我不明白你到底什么意思
I'm trying to figure out what you're suggesting here.

125
00:08:44,365 --> 00:08:46,332
那是佩德罗的问题
Well, that's Pedro's problem.

126
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:48,434
我希望他能理智点
I'm hoping he'll be reasonable.

127
00:08:48,469 --> 00:08:50,169
有人想侵占他的土地
About as reasonable as you'd be

128
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:52,772
你还想让他和你一样理智吗
if someone were trying to chisel you out of your land?

129
00:08:52,807 --> 00:08:54,907
你觉得我们还有办法吗
Do you think we have a choice here?

130
00:08:56,845 --> 00:08:59,812
米德基夫给的钱还能用多久
When does the rest of that money from Midkiff run out?

131
00:09:01,516 --> 00:09:03,826
到圣诞节... 省着用的话
Christmas... if we're careful.

132
00:09:03,826 --> 00:09:06,986
而且 我们还得等新钻井
In the meantime, we're still waiting for that new rig to arrive.

133
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:08,521
即便钻井到手了
And once it does show up,

134
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:10,723
多长时间才能钻出油呢
how long is it gonna take us to hit oil?

135
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,793
几个月 几年
Months? Years?

136
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:17,997
菲尼 你和我要打拼出一些成果...
We're building something here, Finn, you and me...

137
00:09:18,032 --> 00:09:19,699
遗产
A legacy.

138
00:09:19,734 --> 00:09:21,167
你懂的 对不对
You know that, right?

139
00:09:21,202 --> 00:09:23,302
我们想要的未来...
The future we want...

140
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,073
我们为之努力的未来...
the future we're working toward...

141
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,177
如果我们现在不做到 就都没有了
it won't happen unless we make it happen.

142
00:09:31,212 --> 00:09:34,881
至于加西亚的地... 势必要拿下
And that García land... It's a sure thing.

143
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:40,586
好吧
All right, then.

144
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,323
皮特怎么办
What do we do about Pete?

145
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:45,488
不让他知道
Keep him out of it.

146
00:09:45,528 --> 00:09:47,829
- 他会很快发现的 - 不能那么快
- He'll find out soon enough. - Well, not that soon.

147
00:09:47,832 --> 00:09:51,230
我让他去奥斯汀了
I sent him up to Austin.

148
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:56,335
怎么了
What?

149
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:58,704
他和萨莉大吵一场
He and Sally had a big fight.

150
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,407
他现在应该回牧场了
He'll be back at the ranch by now.

151
00:10:01,442 --> 00:10:03,743
糟了
Shit.

152
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:06,679
我们可以跟他谈谈
We can talk to him.

153
00:10:06,714 --> 00:10:08,281
你这么觉得吗
You think so?

154
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,682
我印象里
The last time I checked,

155
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:12,351
玛丽亚·加西亚可还是他们家族的人
Maria García was still a member of that family.

156
00:10:12,387 --> 00:10:14,587
那都是很久以前的事了
Well, that all happened a long time ago.

157
00:10:14,622 --> 00:10:17,623
你弟弟就是个放不下的人
Well, your brother doesn't let things go that easy.

158
00:10:19,394 --> 00:10:21,494
别让他知道
Keep him in the dark.

159
00:10:31,806 --> 00:10:34,473
萨莉怎么了
What happened with Sally?

160
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:38,077
她想留在大城市里 那里过得开心
She's gonna stay in the city, where she's happy.

161
00:10:38,112 --> 00:10:39,912
那是她该待的地方
It's where she belongs.

162
00:10:39,948 --> 00:10:42,281
这是你俩都想要的结果吗
And is that what you both want?

163
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:43,816
是啊
Yeah.

164
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:49,055
你打算自己在这儿住
So you're gonna stay here alone?

165
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:52,825
只要这里属于我们 我就一直住下去
I figure, so long as we can hang onto this place.

166
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,294
你的孩子怎么办
What about your kids?

167
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,298
来点红酒么
Want some wine?

168
00:11:02,437 --> 00:11:04,637
我们所有的红酒杯都被击碎了
All our wine glasses got shot up,

169
00:11:04,672 --> 00:11:06,505
我们只能用这个凑合一下
so we'll have to make do with these.

170
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,692
我不知道如果每天见不到孩子们我该怎么活
I don't know how I'll survive without seeing the kids every day.

171
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,665
说实话 他们还是最好住在城市里...
Truth is, they're better off in the city...

172
00:11:34,335 --> 00:11:36,769
也更安全
and safer.

173
00:12:09,637 --> 00:12:12,338
伊莱不是这样的
It's different with Eli.

174
00:14:37,164 --> 00:14:38,397
法官大人
Your Honor?

175
00:14:38,432 --> 00:14:40,132
能占用您一些时间吗
Might I trouble you for a moment?

176
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:42,134
当然可以 孩子 
Well, sure thing, son.

177
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:44,003
您觉得这个小晚宴
Do you think this little soiree has been

178
00:14:44,038 --> 00:14:45,504
是不是空前的成功
a resounding success, or what?

179
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:47,740
谢谢夸奖
I thank you for that.

180
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,727
看来你的篮子里有宝贝啊
So, you got any aces in that basket there?

181
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,237
那是 您可仔细瞧好了
Well, you'll have to have a look.

182
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,390
真不赖
Well, now.

183
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:06,692
这是上校给您的礼物
It's a gift from the Colonel.

184
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:08,894
这次他又想干什么
What does he need this time?

185
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:10,362
这个 法官大人...
Well, Your Honor...

186
00:15:10,398 --> 00:15:12,331
您办公室里 有一些档案
there are a few records in your office

187
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:13,732
我们想修改一下
we would like to have altered.

188
00:15:13,768 --> 00:15:14,833
继续说
I'm listening.

189
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:17,870
加西亚家的地
The García tract.

190
00:15:17,905 --> 00:15:20,706
佩德罗已经十年没交税了
Pedro hasn't paid his taxes in 10 years now,

191
00:15:20,741 --> 00:15:23,609
罚金也就越积越多
and the penalties have added up substantially.

192
00:15:23,644 --> 00:15:27,346
按道理 这地应该拍卖的 
In fact, it's probably time for a sheriff's sale.

193
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:29,081
老天
Hell.

194
00:15:29,116 --> 00:15:33,185
真庆幸你不是我邻居
I'm sure glad you're not my neighbor.

195
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,920
这里头一共是多少
How much is in there?

196
00:15:34,955 --> 00:15:36,622
五千元
5,000.

197
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:44,430
佩德罗·加西亚从没漏交过税
Pedro García has always paid his taxes on time.

198
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:45,697
那是自然
We know that.

199
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:47,966
他肯定有记录和收据
He'll have records and receipts,

200
00:15:48,002 --> 00:15:50,202
但我估计你也知道
but I guess you know that, too.

201
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:51,236
没错 先生
We do, sir.

202
00:15:53,641 --> 00:15:56,408
我们是不是太贪腐了
We are rotten, aren't we?

203
00:15:56,444 --> 00:15:59,211
真是欲壑难填啊
I mean, how much does one man need?

204
00:15:59,246 --> 00:16:02,581
我在这拥有的土地和特拉华州相当
I-I got a piece of land here the size of Delaware,

205
00:16:02,616 --> 00:16:04,416
但当我看到钱的时候
but I see a pile of money,

206
00:16:04,452 --> 00:16:07,019
仍然无法拒绝
I can't stop myself from picking it up.

207
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:10,656
我就当你同意了
I'll take that as a "yes."

208
00:16:10,691 --> 00:16:14,593
这些先当作定金吧 算一半
Let's make this payment the first half,

209
00:16:14,628 --> 00:16:17,830
事成之后再付另外的一半 怎么样
rest due upon completion of the task, hmm?

210
00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:19,998
可以 先生
Yes, sir.

211
00:16:20,034 --> 00:16:22,034
天哪
Boy.

212
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:27,106
谢谢你
Thank you.

213
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:29,108
那么
So...

214
00:16:29,143 --> 00:16:31,610
你之前没开玩笑吧
were you serious before?

215
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:33,679
我什么都能问吗
I get to ask whatever I want?

216
00:16:33,714 --> 00:16:36,115
当然
Sure.

217
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,283
你和别人有过吗
Have there been other women?

218
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:41,186
除我以外
Besides me?

219
00:16:41,222 --> 00:16:43,489
我结婚以后就没有了
Not once I got married, no.

220
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:45,357
那结婚前呢
What about before?

221
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:46,758
我还是个孩子
I was a kid.

222
00:16:46,794 --> 00:16:49,094
我知道 我记得
I know. I remember.

223
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,396
但你第一次肯定不是跟我
But I couldn't have been your first.

224
00:16:53,634 --> 00:16:55,434
在我十四岁 还在墨西哥的时候
My father took us to a whorehouse

225
00:16:55,469 --> 00:16:57,136
我爸带我们去了妓院
when I was 14 in Mexico.

226
00:16:57,171 --> 00:17:00,272
你喜欢吗
Did you like it?

227
00:17:00,307 --> 00:17:01,874
我去的时候才十四岁啊
I was a 14-year-old boy in a whorehouse.

228
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:05,210
你觉得我能怎样
What do you think?

229
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:06,712
然后就认识了你
And then I met you.

230
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,151
然后呢
And?

231
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:14,853
没有然后
No "and."

232
00:17:14,889 --> 00:17:19,391
你是我女朋友 我心里只有你
You were my girlfriend. I was faithful.

233
00:17:19,426 --> 00:17:22,961
但你结婚了
Until you got married.

234
00:17:22,997 --> 00:17:25,364
对
Yeah.

235
00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:28,634
然后我结婚了
Then I got married.

236
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:31,403
这桩婚事对你父亲为什么那么重要
Why did it mean so much to your father?

237
00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:38,810
为什么得娶萨莉
Why Sally?

238
00:17:38,846 --> 00:17:42,247
他在乎的是她们家的威望  
He liked that her family was respectable.

239
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:46,418
我不太明白
I don't understand it.

240
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:48,554
我也不懂
Me neither.

241
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:51,156
你想让我帮你问他吗
You want me to ask him for you?

242
00:17:51,192 --> 00:17:52,424
不
No.

243
00:17:54,428 --> 00:17:56,228
那你呢
What about you?

244
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,899
好吧
Well...

245
00:18:00,935 --> 00:18:03,735
你是我的第一次
you were my first.

246
00:18:03,771 --> 00:18:07,406
但之后我去了纽约 然后
But then I moved to New York, and...

247
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:08,974
就遇上了别人
there were others.

248
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:13,278
真正的淑女可不会这样
Too big a number for a lady.

249
00:18:18,152 --> 00:18:19,685
在我年轻的时候
When I was younger,

250
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,656
我老是在想... 为什么自己没怀孕
I always... wondered why I didn't get pregnant.

251
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:29,835
而我的朋友们却总是能怀上
I watched all of my friends dealing with it all the time.

252
00:18:29,854 --> 00:18:32,764
然后
But...

253
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:36,493
我意识到可能我就是怀不上
then I just realized maybe I couldn't get pregnant.

254
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:42,975
我没法生育
Maybe I can't.

255
00:18:46,914 --> 00:18:48,914
你在意吗
Does that bother you?

256
00:18:48,949 --> 00:18:50,949
完全不会
Not at all.

257
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:08,233
你为什么不想结婚
Why don't you want to get married?

258
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:11,190
我想自己来挑
I want to choose.

259
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:16,408
你想要自由
You want freedom...

260
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:19,011
但你却有个奴隶
and yet you own a slave.

261
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:20,512
这倒挺有意思
I find that funny.

262
00:19:20,547 --> 00:19:22,359
没人强迫你留在这
Nobody asked you to be here.

263
00:19:22,398 --> 00:19:24,783
你如果想要自由
If you wanted to be free, you should have stayed

264
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:26,852
你就该待在白人的地盘
where the white people come from.

265
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,891
可能伊莱现在就在那
Eli is probably there right now.

266
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:38,030
我希望今晚 他能睡在一张羽绒床上
I hope he's sleeping in a big feather bed tonight,

267
00:19:38,065 --> 00:19:39,931
还枕着两个枕头
two pillows under his head.

268
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:42,134
羽绒床是什么
What's a "feather bed"?

269
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:43,702
天堂
Heaven.

270
00:19:43,737 --> 00:19:45,604
我不懂
I don't understand.

271
00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:46,838
当然
No!

272
00:19:46,874 --> 00:19:48,640
你当然不懂
Of course you don't.

273
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:50,842
因为你就是个恶心的野蛮人
'Cause you're just a disgusting savage.

274
00:19:50,878 --> 00:19:53,612
动手啊 想打就打吧
Go on. You can hit me for saying that if you want.

275
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:56,181
我不介意 毕竟欺凌弱小的感觉确实不错
It's okay. I know it makes you feel strong.

276
00:19:58,218 --> 00:20:00,766
你也就剩这么点本事了 对吧
It's the only power you have left, isn't it?

277
00:20:05,492 --> 00:20:08,293
我们其实是一类人
You and me, we are not so different.

278
00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:10,495
在我当奴隶的这段时间里
I've been a slave for a while now,

279
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:12,597
我明白了一些事情
and I've learned a few tricks.

280
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:17,969
当你的新郎跟你发生关系的时候
When your new husband is putting his baby in you,

281
00:20:18,005 --> 00:20:21,707
或许能让你想起过去美好的时光
it might help you to think of a happy memory from your past.

282
00:20:22,843 --> 00:20:26,345
或许是时候好好想想伊莱
Maybe that would be a good time for you to remember Eli.

283
00:21:31,978 --> 00:21:34,780
你的老公怎么做的
So, what happened with your husband?

284
00:21:37,117 --> 00:21:41,686
亨利抛弃了我 因为发现我无法生育
Henry left me... when I couldn't give him a baby.

285
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,994
不过没关系 他是个好男人
But it's okay. He wasn't a good man.

286
00:21:51,265 --> 00:21:53,165
我不知所措
I was stuck.

287
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,400
你知道吗
You know that?

288
00:21:55,436 --> 00:21:58,336
我们过去住在康州格林尼治村的出租房里
We were living in a tenement in Greenwich Village.

289
00:21:58,372 --> 00:22:01,873
一层楼的住户共用一个卫生间
We shared a bathroom with the whole floor.

290
00:22:04,344 --> 00:22:08,180
我把婚戒当了才买到车票回家
I had to pawn my wedding ring to get a ticket home.

291
00:22:10,117 --> 00:22:12,818
你可以找我啊 我会帮你的
You could've contacted me. I would've helped you.

292
00:22:12,853 --> 00:22:14,319
是吗
Really?

293
00:22:14,354 --> 00:22:17,189
你会给我汇钱吗
You would have wired me money?

294
00:22:17,224 --> 00:22:18,757
瞒着萨莉
Behind Sally's back?

295
00:22:18,792 --> 00:22:20,058
玛丽亚 我肯定会帮你的
I would've done something to help you, Maria.

296
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,869
拜托 你得信我
Come on. You have to know that.

297
00:22:23,063 --> 00:22:24,963
我还以为我们能成一对
I thought we were gonna get married.

298
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:29,835
可是你因为一面之缘的女人... 抛弃了我
And then you left me... for a woman you just met.

299
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,271
我也于心不忍 我每时每刻都在想你
It was awful for me, too. I missed you all the time.

300
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:38,944
我恨我父亲替我做的决定
I hated my father putting me in that position.

301
00:22:38,979 --> 00:22:40,378
是啊
Yeah.

302
00:22:40,414 --> 00:22:43,348
你一定很煎熬吧
I'm sure you suffered.

303
00:22:46,153 --> 00:22:48,553
你有自己的生活
You had a life.

304
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:50,655
你可以随心所欲无所顾忌
You could do whatever you wanted.

305
00:22:50,691 --> 00:22:52,691
可我不像你有得选
I don't have any of your choices.

306
00:22:52,726 --> 00:22:55,660
我没有钱 没有本事 没办法独自维生
I have no money, no skills, no way to survive on my own.

307
00:22:55,696 --> 00:22:57,796
你难道不懂吗
Do you not understand that?

308
00:23:08,108 --> 00:23:10,041
没错
You're right.

309
00:23:10,077 --> 00:23:13,011
我对你不公平
I haven't been fair to you.

310
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:14,913
我希望再来一次
I wish I could take that time back,

311
00:23:14,948 --> 00:23:16,915
做些弥补
do it all different.

312
00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:22,354
你不行
Well, you can't.

313
00:23:22,389 --> 00:23:25,156
我可以的
No, I can't.

314
00:23:25,192 --> 00:23:26,892
对不起
I'm sorry.

315
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,563
真对不起
I'm sorry.

316
00:24:08,753 --> 00:24:11,287
你们是来打鹌鹑的吗
Are you here to shoot quail?!

317
00:24:11,322 --> 00:24:12,621
不是
No! No!

318
00:24:12,623 --> 00:24:13,856
你们是来打野鸭的吗
Are you here to hunt duck?

319
00:24:13,891 --> 00:24:15,124
不是
No! No!

320
00:24:15,126 --> 00:24:16,692
当然不是
God damn right, you're not.

321
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:19,762
我满怀荣幸 欢迎各位参加
It is with enormous pleasure that I welcome y'all

322
00:24:19,797 --> 00:24:23,766
撒迪厄斯·基尔伯恩主办的第三届甜蜜狩猎
to Thaddeus Kilborne's Third Annual Honey Hunt!

323
00:24:26,437 --> 00:24:27,803
每一位美女的篮子里
Now, each of these fine ladies

324
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:30,272
装着一瓶波本威士忌
has a basket with a bottle of bourbon...

325
00:24:30,308 --> 00:24:32,375
- 好呀 - 一个核桃派
- Yeah! - A pecan pie...

326
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,143
- 没错 - 还有一条毯子
- Yeah! - And a blanket...

327
00:24:34,178 --> 00:24:37,313
以免芒刺粘在裤子上
so you don't get burrs on your trousers.

328
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,650
我们让这群姑娘先跑一步
We'll let these ladies get a little head start,

329
00:24:41,686 --> 00:24:44,220
然后再开始捕猎
and then we'll start huntin'!

330
00:24:46,591 --> 00:24:49,191
没错 我们可不能刁难他们
That's right, we can't make it too difficult for them.

331
00:24:51,095 --> 00:24:54,263
你跟撒迪厄斯说了吗
You speak to Thaddeus?

332
00:24:54,298 --> 00:24:55,431
说了
Yeah.

333
00:24:55,466 --> 00:24:58,334
顺利吗
How'd it go?

334
00:24:58,369 --> 00:24:59,935
这辈子最没难度的会面
Easiest meeting of my life.

335
00:25:03,374 --> 00:25:05,908
有迟疑吗
Second thoughts?

336
00:25:05,943 --> 00:25:08,511
顺其自然吧
It is what it is.

337
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:15,684
- 既然这样... - 是的
- Well, given the situation... - Yeah.

338
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,354
- 我们还是分开吧 - 最好不过了
- We should split up. - Probably for the best.

339
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:51,887
你要去哪 到这来
Where you going? Come back here!

340
00:25:53,724 --> 00:25:56,492
诶哟哟
Well, well!

341
00:25:56,527 --> 00:25:59,195
算你走运
Lucky you.

342
00:26:01,098 --> 00:26:02,598
你好
Hi.

343
00:26:04,922 --> 00:26:06,422
要坐会儿吗
Wanna sit?

344
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:09,972
虽然很诱人
Uh, that's a lovely invitation,

345
00:26:10,007 --> 00:26:12,408
但是你应该更喜欢
but I think you'd prefer one of the other gentlemen

346
00:26:12,443 --> 00:26:13,676
等会儿过来的男人吧
who's about to come this way.

347
00:26:13,711 --> 00:26:16,245
这就未必了
Oh, I don't know.

348
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,748
我看你就很帅啊
You look pretty handsome to me.

349
00:26:21,352 --> 00:26:25,020
你的结婚戒指去哪了
And what happened to your wedding ring?

350
00:26:25,056 --> 00:26:27,923
丢了吗
You lose track of it?

351
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:31,327
可惜了 我还没有遇上心仪的姑娘
Tragically, I have not yet met the right young lady.

352
00:26:31,362 --> 00:26:34,497
或许应该有所改变
Maybe that's about to change.

353
00:26:34,532 --> 00:26:38,100
我们在毯子上哪也不去
We're not stepping off this blanket

354
00:26:38,135 --> 00:26:41,036
除非我让你忘记...
until I make you forget...

355
00:26:41,072 --> 00:26:42,738
每一个...
every...

356
00:26:42,773 --> 00:26:46,408
相处过的女人
woman you've ever been with.

357
00:26:46,444 --> 00:26:48,944
小姐 你的志气值得赞扬
Your ambition does you credit, ma'am.

358
00:26:50,715 --> 00:26:53,782
喜欢吗
You like this?

359
00:26:53,818 --> 00:26:56,719
谁不喜欢香吻呢 很舒服
Who doesn't like kisses? They are very pleasant.

360
00:26:56,754 --> 00:26:59,021
这样呢
How 'bout this?

361
00:26:59,056 --> 00:27:01,223
这个嘛...
That is, uh...

362
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:03,259
你太热情了
That's very kind of you.

363
00:27:06,497 --> 00:27:11,467
现在呢
Well... how 'bout this?

364
00:27:11,502 --> 00:27:14,436
你放轻松
You just relax...

365
00:27:14,472 --> 00:27:16,939
幻想我是另一个人
and pretend I'm someone else.

366
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:45,134
您是伊莱·麦卡洛上校吧
You are Colonel Eli McCullough, right?

367
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:48,270
正是在下
Guilty as charged.

368
00:28:00,318 --> 00:28:03,319
我不会说科曼切语
I don't speak Comanche.

369
00:28:03,354 --> 00:28:05,487
但至少你听出来了
But you knew enough to recognize it.

370
00:28:05,523 --> 00:28:07,056
你们是那个部落的
Who are your people?

371
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:11,627
不是科曼切
Not Comanche.

372
00:28:11,662 --> 00:28:13,596
但你应该认识
But I think you might know them.

373
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,967
这又是怎么回事 亲爱的
What's this about, honey?

374
00:28:18,002 --> 00:28:20,636
想让我掏钱还有更简单的办法
There's easier ways to get money off me.

375
00:28:20,671 --> 00:28:23,105
我不是来要钱的
I'm not here for money.

376
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,374
我是里本阿帕奇人
I'm Lipan Apache.

377
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:34,450
墨西哥来的
From Mexico.

378
00:28:34,485 --> 00:28:36,852
维拉村落附近吗
Near Villa Unión?

379
00:28:37,555 --> 00:28:39,955
你们一群人闯进了我们村子
You and your men came into my village.

380
00:28:39,991 --> 00:28:42,191
除了我的父亲
You killed everyone you could find,

381
00:28:42,226 --> 00:28:44,994
找得到的都杀光了
except my father.

382
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:47,162
有趣的是
You know what's funny,

383
00:28:47,198 --> 00:28:49,365
我以为你已经忘记了
is I wasn't even sure you would remember.

384
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,067
我记得很清楚
I remember him well.

385
00:28:52,103 --> 00:28:55,371
很就以前的事了
That was a long time ago.

386
00:28:55,413 --> 00:28:58,080
当时的我还不是这样
I was a different man then.

387
00:28:58,109 --> 00:29:02,211
你父亲和族人杀了我的妻儿
And your father and his people killed my wife and son.

388
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,282
为你妻儿报仇要杀掉村子里所有人吗
An entire village for your wife and son?!

389
00:29:11,188 --> 00:29:13,022
这段纠葛早就化解了
That war's long over.

390
00:29:13,057 --> 00:29:14,657
来坐吧
Come and sit down.

391
00:29:14,692 --> 00:29:17,259
你不知道我们还有很多共同点
We have more in common than you think.

392
00:29:17,294 --> 00:29:18,394
站住
Stop.

393
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:22,031
你叫什么名字
Tell me your name.

394
00:29:24,468 --> 00:29:26,301
伊莱
Eli?!

395
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:45,881
天哪
Oh, God.

396
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:16,478
救命
Help.

397
00:30:16,513 --> 00:30:18,280
救命啊
Help!

398
00:30:18,315 --> 00:30:20,816
我中枪了
I've been shot!

399
00:31:20,911 --> 00:31:22,811
抱不过来的
Can't hold them all.

400
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:30,719
被你干掉的人命数得过来吗
Can you even count all the lives you've ended?

401
00:31:40,097 --> 00:31:42,097
怎么回事
What's happening here?

402
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:46,835
你是印第安神祗传来的神谕
Are you a message from The Great Spirit?

403
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,337
那个阿帕奇女孩
That Apache gal...

404
00:31:49,373 --> 00:31:52,140
她就是指示
Pretty sure that was a message.

405
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,009
她想置我于死地
She just wanted me dead.

406
00:31:54,044 --> 00:31:56,278
那就是给你的指示
That's a hell of a message.

407
00:31:58,782 --> 00:32:02,384
骑马去
Get on the horse.

408
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,761
我还没准备好
I'm not ready.

409
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:16,164
你就是杀人机器啊 老头
You're a loaded gun, old man.

410
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,367
没了你的世界更美好
It's a better world without you in it.

411
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,611
别急
Easy there.

412
00:32:34,418 --> 00:32:36,952
来吧 我们一起
Come on. We'll do it together.

413
00:33:02,186 --> 00:33:04,053
听得见吗
Can you hear me?

414
00:33:04,081 --> 00:33:05,647
别回头
Don't look back.

415
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:08,617
坚持住 爸爸
Hang on. Hang on, Daddy.

416
00:33:08,652 --> 00:33:10,014
别回头
Don't look back.

417
00:33:10,017 --> 00:33:12,420
爸爸撑住 我们带你去看医生
Hold on, Daddy. We're gonna get you to a doctor, okay?

418
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:18,393
爸爸撑住 有我在
Hang on, Daddy! I gotcha!

419
00:33:18,428 --> 00:33:22,297
爸 别放弃 我们带你去看医生
Daddy?! Hold on. We're gonna get you to a doctor, okay?

420
00:33:22,332 --> 00:33:24,599
告诉我们 怎么回事
Okay, but tell us, you gotta tell me what happened.

421
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,401
我没事
I'm fine.

422
00:33:26,436 --> 00:33:28,603
谁干的 告诉我 是谁对你下的手
Well, who did this?! Tell me! Who did this to you?!

423
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,510
不知道 没看清是谁
I don't know. I didn't see the fella.

424
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:38,947
他中正你的胸膛 怎么会没看见呢
Well, he shot you in the chest! How did you miss seeing him?!

425
00:33:38,982 --> 00:33:40,682
太黑了
It was dark!

426
00:33:43,653 --> 00:33:46,621
好了 对不起
All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

427
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:48,156
别愣着
Don't just stand there!

428
00:33:48,191 --> 00:33:50,592
快 找人帮忙 去开车
Come on! Go get some help! Get a truck started!

429
00:33:50,627 --> 00:33:52,327
得救他出去
We gotta get him outta here!

430
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,266
很快就天亮了
It'll be light soon.

431
00:36:50,507 --> 00:36:53,341
我得走了
I gotta go.

432
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,610
别走
No.

433
00:36:55,645 --> 00:36:59,380
我会编个故事
Mm, I'll have to invent some story.

434
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:00,849
我要告诉家人
I'll have to tell them

435
00:37:00,884 --> 00:37:03,218
我在朋友家过夜了
that I spent the night at a friend's house.

436
00:37:03,253 --> 00:37:04,786
你是成熟的女性了
You're a grown woman.

437
00:37:04,821 --> 00:37:07,689
我还是为人子女
I'm still their daughter.

438
00:37:07,724 --> 00:37:09,357
去他的
Hell with that.

439
00:37:11,695 --> 00:37:14,095
带上东西 来吧
Get your things. Come on.

440
00:37:17,453 --> 00:37:19,053
什么
What?

441
00:37:19,056 --> 00:37:21,202
你不希望别人对你指指点点
You don't want anyone telling you what to do anymore,

442
00:37:21,204 --> 00:37:23,571
品头论足
how to live your life...

443
00:37:23,607 --> 00:37:25,840
那 我们就走
so come on, let's go.

444
00:37:30,213 --> 00:37:31,980
你开玩笑的
You're joking.

445
00:37:32,015 --> 00:37:34,215
楼上的保险箱里还有点钱
We got some money in the safe upstairs.

446
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:37,886
我们去蒙大拿 我去给人打下手
We'll head up to Montana. I'll get work there as a hand.

447
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:39,254
- 我们现在就走吧 - 不
- Let's leave right now. - No.

448
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:41,589
- 不再回来 - 别这样
- Never come back. - Do... Don't.

449
00:37:44,394 --> 00:37:47,028
你不能这么对我
You can't say that to me.

450
00:37:48,765 --> 00:37:50,031
这样不公平
It's not fair.

451
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:51,599
我爱你
I love you.

452
00:38:00,043 --> 00:38:03,711
我不要跟有妇之夫私奔 皮特
I'm not running off with a married man, Pete.

453
00:38:03,747 --> 00:38:05,647
你打消这个念头吧
So put that out of your head.

454
00:38:12,322 --> 00:38:14,622
好的
Okay.

455
00:38:14,658 --> 00:38:17,258
那我们怎么办
So, what are we gonna do?

456
00:38:36,246 --> 00:38:37,846
是谁
Who is it?

457
00:38:37,881 --> 00:38:41,082
佩德罗·加西亚
Pedro García.

458
00:38:41,117 --> 00:38:43,418
门没锁 进来吧
It's not locked. Come on in.

459
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,557
你好啊 兄弟
How are you, amigo?

460
00:38:51,061 --> 00:38:52,727
要喝点东西吗
Can I get you something?

461
00:38:52,762 --> 00:38:54,863
我可以煮一壶咖啡
I can make a pot of coffee.

462
00:38:54,898 --> 00:38:57,098
不用了
No.

463
00:38:57,133 --> 00:38:59,133
我一会儿就走
I won't stay long.

464
00:39:01,137 --> 00:39:04,172
玛丽亚彻夜未归
Maria was out all night.

465
00:39:05,966 --> 00:39:09,068
我觉得她在这
I believe she was here.

466
00:39:09,103 --> 00:39:11,937
我结婚了 佩德罗
I'm a married man, Pedro.

467
00:39:11,972 --> 00:39:14,640
你的种种猜测 我觉得你是误会了
Whatever you think is going on, I believe you're mistaken.

468
00:39:16,444 --> 00:39:18,210
我的女儿...
My daughter...

469
00:39:18,245 --> 00:39:19,978
她是寡妇
she's a widow.

470
00:39:20,014 --> 00:39:22,581
她悲痛成疾
She's sick with grief

471
00:39:22,616 --> 00:39:26,819
对于行为无法负责
and not responsible for her actions.

472
00:39:26,854 --> 00:39:30,723
要是有人占了这个便宜
A man who takes advantage of this...

473
00:39:30,758 --> 00:39:34,326
根本不算男人
is not a man at all.

474
00:39:34,362 --> 00:39:36,562
我没有占你女儿的便宜
I'm not taking advantage of her.

475
00:39:36,597 --> 00:39:37,796
你的话当真吗
You really believe that?

476
00:39:37,832 --> 00:39:40,032
千真万确
With all my heart.

477
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:46,772
今天登门拜访的时候
When I knocked on your door today,

478
00:39:46,807 --> 00:39:48,774
我把手枪留在车里了
I left my pistol in my car.

479
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:52,544
下次再来 我会拿在手上
Next time I come, it will be in my hand.

480
00:41:40,437 --> 00:41:42,037
情况如何 医生
Hey, what's the verdict, Doc?

481
00:41:42,072 --> 00:41:44,039
把他的肺部的积液清除了
Got all the fluid out of his lungs,

482
00:41:44,074 --> 00:41:46,909
但如果动作幅度过大 肺就会再次垮掉
but if he moves around too much, his lung will collapse again,

483
00:41:46,944 --> 00:41:48,877
可能会致命
and it'll probably kill him.

484
00:41:48,913 --> 00:41:51,246
- 确保他别胡来 - 好的 好的
- Make sure he takes it easy. - Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

485
00:41:51,282 --> 00:41:53,615
- 谢谢你的努力 - 不客气
- Thank you for everything you've done. - Appreciate it.

486
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,461
没事的 撑住
You're gonna make it, okay? Just hang in there.

1
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,120
今天狩猎成果颇丰呀

2
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,370
"白人小子"在哪儿

3
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,370
他走了

4
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,960
你说清楚

5
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,050
我撞见他在打猎 遇上了马群 "白人小子"帮我抓

6
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,300
我们说好了

7
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,800
什么意思

8
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,640
如果我让他逃走...

9
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,220
...所有的马都归我

10
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,980
我不信

11
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,900
"白人小子"不会扔下我们

12
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,650
你怎么知道的

13
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,370
他跟你说的吗

14
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,490
白人谎话连篇

15
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,580
他们就这点能耐

16
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,130
托施威你被骗了

17
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,800
他不会忘记自己是俘虏

18
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,680
他骗你教他技能 就为了逃跑

19
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,470
你太信任他了

20
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,560
看着我的眼睛 告诉我

21
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,230
我是科曼切人

22
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,400
我不对同族人说谎

23
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:44,870
我不想你和树敌

24
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,040
我给你一匹马弥补奴隶的损失

25
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,830
他不是奴隶

26
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:36,080
圣安东尼奥 红灯区 1915年

27
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:55,610
"征敌"告诉大家 "白人小子"回去找白人了

28
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,280
你不相信"白人小子"会离开我们吧

29
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,610
我了解他

30
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,200
你也是

31
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,120
人心难测

32
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,540
不是的

33
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,580
你必须去找他

34
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,420
我为什么要这么做

35
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,720
你对他视如己出

36
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,310
我们都看在眼里

37
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,350
即便如此

38
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,100
我的儿子来去自由

39
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,560
你究竟在意什么

40
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:40,530
你和他不能有接触了 你都快结婚了

41
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,320
什么

42
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,490
你爸爸没告诉你么

43
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,740
没

44
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,870
他接受了"征敌"的礼物

45
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,710
很遗憾

46
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,310
爸爸

47
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,850
爸爸

48
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,650
"征敌"是不是给你下聘礼了

49
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,570
是啊 你要嫁给他了

50
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,030
你为什么不告诉我

51
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,530
我不想吵架

52
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,450
我不想嫁给他

53
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,500
胡说

54
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,420
我想和别人在一起

55
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,880
你想要的人已经走了

56
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,670
你妈妈和我都很开心

57
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,050
嫁给他 你也会很高兴的

58
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,710
我亲生父亲不会这样逼我

59
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,180
但你亲生父亲却没法保护你

60
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,720
你母亲和我把你放在心上

61
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:53,060
但我们现在老了 你就得回过头来照顾我们

62
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,110
这是你的责任

63
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,950
快干活

64
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,400
坐吧

65
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,400
别太拘束

66
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,620
你跑不掉的

67
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,250
我想谈一谈

68
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,000
你这么做是不对的

69
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,880
你是你爸爸唯一有价值的东西

70
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,880
就这么跑了 你们家就一无所有了

71
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
拜托你放我走

72
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,690
如果取消婚约 我就把马要回来

73
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,900
冬天也不会给你家送肉

74
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:56,820
你的养父就只好乞求残羹冷炙了

75
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:01,490
他为你付出这么多

76
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,700
难道你不欠他体面的日子吗

77
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,540
我会当个好丈夫 让你衣食无忧

78
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:18,220
别犯傻 跟我回去吧

79
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:28,560
如果我走了 你会来追我吗

80
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,770
不会

81
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,490
永别了 草原之花

82
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,330
等一下

83
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,950
她是自愿回来的吗

84
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,370
是的

85
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,830
谢谢你 女儿 谢谢你
