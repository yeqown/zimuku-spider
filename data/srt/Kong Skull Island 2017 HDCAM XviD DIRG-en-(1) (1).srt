Selamat MENONTON "Hong Kong: Skull Island" by the Guavaberry

2
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:43,275
LF We can use this incredible machine ...

3
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:47,375
Victory for peace

4
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:52,251
We are entering a period of human history, the greatest.

5
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:04,363
Satellite progress Hamu progress can not be equated

6
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:08,268
Our progress in the ballistic missiles with.

7
00:03:08,437 --> 00:03:17,243
And expansion of this time, the scene ...

8
00:03:20,282 --> 00:03:26,243
This is the first time we put the camera see the Earth in the sky.

9
00:03:26,255 --> 00:03:30,385
We found places where we have never seen before.

10
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:39,257
The smartest tenant is a person or a machine monkeys.

11
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:47,299
We are in this new sea because knowledge in the tank.

12
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:52,440
We are looking for peace, or cause fear a new war.

13
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:59,284
Overcoming human cruelty, and make it in this world is safe.

14
00:04:00,322 --> 00:04:02,483
We are committed to it.

15
00:04:18,307 --> 00:04:22,403
The Committee of the Congress rally stalled citizens ...

16
00:04:22,444 --> 00:04:26,505
The next few days in a certain density.

17
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:33,320
Mark my words. Currently in Washington has never been so bad.

18
00:04:33,322 --> 00:04:35,415
Do not interfere.

19
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:45,456
This is not a good time to ask.

20
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:49,403
There will be shut down, Brooks. We're out of money!

21
00:04:49,438 --> 00:04:53,397
After the end of this war, our adventure will not be approved.

22
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:59,275
We will not do with our presentation.

23
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:06,320
And in the form of a stack of paper. One day, I can compile it, membundelnya.

24
00:05:06,355 --> 00:05:13,523
Today we agreed to end the war and bring peace to Vietnam.

25
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:16,327
The entire US troops will be withdrawn.

26
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:18,493
We do not have a day. Hello there.

27
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:24,395
- Miranda met with Senator Phil Willis. - Of course, Mr. relics.

28
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,343
L to leave a message in the morning to reschedule appointments.

29
00:05:29,378 --> 00:05:32,245
In a few weeks spare time.

30
00:05:35,517 --> 00:05:40,250
- Jesus. I do not accept the message, Randa? - You're happy.

31
00:05:40,356 --> 00:05:41,516
mobile? Five?

32
00:05:41,523 --> 00:05:44,287
They will be ignored. Only for a moment.

33
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:49,297
You have five minutes. L appointment late ...

34
00:05:49,398 --> 00:05:52,367
This time to find what imaginary monster?

35
00:05:53,302 --> 00:06:01,232
These photos are not mapped in the South Pacific region. Not found.

36
00:06:02,277 --> 00:06:05,337
Many speak of civilization.

37
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:07,347
Skull Island.

38
00:06:08,283 --> 00:06:10,513
There, the Lord did not finish the creation.

39
00:06:11,453 --> 00:06:15,355
It is understood that many ships and aircraft disappeared there.

40
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:18,483
Bermuda Triangle?

41
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:23,454
Aluminum or paper hat liters weekend?

42
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:29,302
Compared to the triangular hat, but I think more than that.

43
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:33,365
Castle Bravo nuclear test in 1954?

44
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:37,269
It is not a trial. They are trying to kill something.

45
00:06:37,513 --> 00:06:42,416
I'm sure there are ecosystems do not know.

46
00:06:43,252 --> 00:06:46,380
Its place is on this island.

47
00:06:46,455 --> 00:06:49,390
Myth and science meet.

48
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:53,251
Randa, this fairy tale.

49
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,259
Harry Truman did not expect that, when the financial monarchy in 1946.

50
00:07:02,304 --> 00:07:06,400
This is a waste ...... monarch ranked at the top to search for extraterrestrial life.

51
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:09,205
Well, they're crazy.

52
00:07:10,512 --> 00:07:13,242
We should put you off.

53
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:15,340
This is an opportunity for our country.

54
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,218
Senator Landsat send a delegation to the island.

55
00:07:19,254 --> 00:07:21,313
We took action.

56
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:23,357
If you agree, of course.

57
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:25,317
You expect to find it?

58
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:30,264
Resources, cure cancer, geological discovery.

59
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,458
Perhaps the alternative fuels. senator...

60
00:07:33,268 --> 00:07:37,227
...... I honestly do not know what happened there.

61
00:07:37,372 --> 00:07:39,397
This is what we know:

62
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:43,377
Tomorrow night, Novosat Russia will melewati this area.

63
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:47,371
And three days, they will have the same image. Whether it is...

64
00:07:48,517 --> 00:07:52,283
You want to find him.

65
00:07:53,322 --> 00:07:55,256
correct?

66
00:07:57,292 --> 00:08:01,388
I can not believe you said, it's almost ridiculous.

67
00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:03,457
Best regards.

68
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:07,359
So you can menunpang.

69
00:08:07,536 --> 00:08:10,505
Listen, this is the last time. very long.

70
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,434
You promise? Finally, help?

71
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:18,470
senator?

72
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:21,249
another.

73
00:08:23,285 --> 00:08:25,412
We need military escort.

74
00:08:58,387 --> 00:08:59,445
- Hey, Mills. - Yes?

75
00:08:59,488 --> 00:09:01,422
How many can believe it?

76
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,384
10

77
00:09:04,426 --> 00:09:07,293
- He told us how? - I do not know, three, four.

78
00:09:08,363 --> 00:09:10,297
Your mother sucks.

79
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:16,499
- It was explained that the Cole. - Later, I ordered, when they met him.

80
00:09:16,538 --> 00:09:18,335
I'm sure your mother sucks.

81
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:20,435
correct?

82
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:44,398

00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:50,463
OK

85
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:54,467
What are your plans when you return to the world, Chapman?

86
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,471
In the eastern routes ajob waiting.

87
00:09:58,313 --> 00:10:00,406
The reason Billy moved to Atlanta ...

88
00:10:01,249 --> 00:10:04,309
They are waiting for me. How about you?

89
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,453
All this for what?

90
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:08,517
So what?

91
00:10:10,492 --> 00:10:13,256
Go, Chapman. have fun.

92
00:10:13,462 --> 00:10:15,327

93
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:18,431
great.

94
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:31,378
Colonel HP!

95
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,314
You have your phone.

96
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:39,286
- It's HP. - HP, this is the general ward.

97
00:10:39,287 --> 00:10:41,414
You and your soldiers are ready to the surgery last?

98
00:10:41,456 --> 00:10:42,445
I do not mind, sir.

99
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:46,416
Sidangmu process. I do not want to rest?

100
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:48,520
Here pass command, sir.

101
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,395
Do not get too excited.

102
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:53,526
A group of scientists is called the Landsat discovered new islands from their satellites.

103
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,500
They need helikpter research.

104
00:10:56,538 --> 00:10:58,233
Understood.

105
00:10:58,273 --> 00:10:59,501
Also, the master? - Yes?

106
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,406
Best regards.

107
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,481
Randa, I'm confused. You get a military escort.

108
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,318
Why do I need a tracker? SAS Why? !

109
00:11:14,322 --> 00:11:17,348
Former SAS. It's ok.

110
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:20,385
He helped Danang 12 pilot crashed in '72.

111
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,523
But your sources, he spent some time at the bar expensive.

112
00:11:24,232 --> 00:11:26,393
Your degree at Yale to lead us in the forest, Brooks?

113
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:30,371
My father said that when he held his drink the way to judge.

114
00:11:30,405 --> 00:11:32,373
You know each other?

115
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:48,516
- OK. Although he needs to know? - What is agreed upon.

116
00:12:18,553 --> 00:12:22,250
Who else worth talking to people.

117
00:12:22,257 --> 00:12:26,216
Uncharted Island? I will tell you the following things that can kill you.

118
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:30,321
Rain, heat, mud, flies and mosquitoes,

119
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:34,268
You can use Atabrine malaria, how many other bacteria?

120
00:12:34,302 --> 00:12:37,499
Let alone eat your animals.

121
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:41,270
- We double your winnings. - Do you know how dangerous this is.

122
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:44,307
I think five times.

123
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:48,245
Bonus if we survived.

124
00:12:50,318 --> 00:12:55,483
Pay him. I think Mr. Conrad will get fair pay.

125
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:00,519
- There is a separate weight gain. - one question.

126
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,431
You are here looking for clues.

127
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:08,236
Who or what KuLacak?

128
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:13,469
The information we get. No card. Only satellite imagery.

129
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:19,243
We need people like you, their particular expertise in the jungle ...

130
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:21,406
Our land-based adventure.

131
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:25,318
We only scientists and researchers. We need experienced people.

132
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,511
Next thing you know there's a problem.

133
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,283
Now find something, TN. Conrad.

134
00:13:33,495 --> 00:13:37,363
Jika must have found it ...... you home.

135
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:05,283
- Weaver. Hey, Jerry. Tell you? - This is Jerry.

136
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:08,353
- Landsat? You can. - is that true?

137
00:14:10,332 --> 00:14:16,362
Anchored in Bangkok. Pier 14 tomorrow 18:00.

138
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:18,302
Tomorrow

139
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,440
Thank you. I owe you.

140
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:23,403
I do not understand. Why do you want to join the mapping

141
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,504
Task, they are covered at the scheduled time?

142
00:14:25,513 --> 00:14:30,416
LF three sources who said the same thing, you know you're lying.

143
00:14:31,353 --> 00:14:35,517
Here are some things. Keeping things confidential.

144
00:14:58,313 --> 00:15:02,249
I can not believe he did. really?

145
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:03,376
Another day 7454300

146
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,316
a new day!

147
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,456
Now, we have to go to another island ...

148
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,355
Another forest.

149
00:15:10,392 --> 00:15:13,259
Vietnam is not an island, stupid.

150
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:15,258
West Island, and then ...

151
00:15:15,263 --> 00:15:17,322
I'd better go there.

152
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:22,300
- Drinking. - This is not an island, it is the key.

153
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,474
This is not funny, Cole.

154
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:45,323
- Mason Weaver, a photographer. - Mason Weaver's wife?

155
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,358
Final inspection liters.

156
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,296
what should I do?

157
00:15:58,273 --> 00:16:00,434
Here two years. You anywhere?

158
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:02,340
Together with the MACV-SOG.

159
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:04,378
You've come to a dangerous place.

160
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:06,344
I respect that.

161
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:10,376
Because men like losing support in the United States.

162
00:16:11,252 --> 00:16:15,211
You will not hold it against unarmed people have lost the war, right?

163
00:16:15,423 --> 00:16:17,414
The camera is more dangerous than guns.

164
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:20,420
We did not lose the war ...... we left it.

165
00:16:21,496 --> 00:16:23,361
correct.

166
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:35,408
welcome. Site supervisors of Landsat liters 维克多涅韦斯.

167
00:16:35,443 --> 00:16:39,277
This is my partner, Steve Woodward, part of the data.

168
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:45,410
The expedition took us to the best place to avoid hundreds of years.

169
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:51,357
According storm surrounding the endlessly satellite islands ...

170
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:54,351
The island hide hidden from the outside world.

171
00:16:54,396 --> 00:17:00,335
Helicopter Colonel Packard was the first on the island.

172
00:17:00,435 --> 00:17:05,338
You'll join us for the first time up bodies ...

173
00:17:05,373 --> 00:17:11,369
Accompanied by Mr. Miranda, Miss St. biologists, geologists, TN leadership. Brooks.

174
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:13,470
We focused on the surface of the island ...

175
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:16,279
Below.

176
00:17:16,317 --> 00:17:18,410
- Mr. Brooks. - Easy.

177
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:23,514
We used dynamite to create mmetakan island vibration on the surface.

178
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:26,460
You are flying from the south, down explosives

179
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:29,362
Earthquake, understand the density of the soil.

180
00:17:29,397 --> 00:17:30,489
He dropped the bomb?

181
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:33,493
Scientific equipment.

182
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:36,504
Did you hear that? Now, our scientists!

183
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:39,465
You're not a scientist.

184
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:44,342
We went down, led by Mr. Conrad land expedition made camp.

185
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:46,506
Mayor Jack Chapman.

186
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:50,484
Once the storm will reach the island ...... radio interference boat.

187
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:52,350
This means that we will be alone.

188
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:56,355
After three days, the team will meet here to complement our island.

189
00:17:56,424 --> 00:18:00,258
Seemingly chance to return from an unknown time.

190
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:02,363
all...

191
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:05,330
Do not miss.

192
00:18:25,453 --> 00:18:27,318
What are you doing here?

193
00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:29,456
what are you doing?

194
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:33,452
Why wear an explosive geological mapping mission?

195
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:35,360
You're listening to class.

196
00:18:35,363 --> 00:18:39,459
- Explosion geology earthquake. - Do you believe?

197
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:41,332
I'm not saying.

198
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:42,496
Have you seen Colonel Packard?

199
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:45,404
- Yes. - They are very nervous.

200
00:18:45,507 --> 00:18:48,476
War hero. where are we.

201
00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:51,411
What about you?

202
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:55,313
This portrait photographers mapping mission.

203
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,250
Correct image to form an opinion.

204
00:18:57,285 --> 00:19:01,244
And conquered the Pulitzer Prize. - Well, Colonel Conrad.

205
00:19:01,322 --> 00:19:04,450
How about you? Why British special forces involved in?

206
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:06,450
Call Conrad. Microliters relieved.

207
00:19:08,363 --> 00:19:09,387
They gave me the money.

208
00:19:09,397 --> 00:19:11,365
I do not like mercenaries.

209
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:13,334
You do not like a war photographer.

210
00:19:13,468 --> 00:19:15,459
Anti-war photographer.

211
00:19:31,452 --> 00:19:33,386
You write chapter?

212
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:35,388
For my son.

213
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:41,258
Billy expensive. Tata promises a home for her birthday, but my father was lying.

214
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:42,388
I'm a bad father.

215
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,455
I hope this letter amend father.

216
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:15,489
Storm looks worse people.

217
00:20:16,331 --> 00:20:18,424
We should postpone this task.

218
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:22,428
- This is how the island? - 50 miles maybe more.

219
00:20:23,304 --> 00:20:25,534
- US lebh close. - You're floating. You get out of here.

220
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:29,469
- I can break, Colonel? - This is our chance.

221
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:32,412
Through this hole. It is a low-pressure air.

222
00:20:32,513 --> 00:20:36,347
I appreciate your enthusiasm, but as an institution

223
00:20:36,384 --> 00:20:39,376
Randa controller canceled the task.

224
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:43,484
AWIS decision. Landsat tour is undoubtedly inspire courage.

225
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,350
I hope you are inspired by my fears.

226
00:20:46,427 --> 00:20:48,292
This is the only map study.

227
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:53,256
Until the last pristine areas on Earth. You are not because of the rain?

228
00:20:53,301 --> 00:20:54,393
Stay on board, if you like.

229
00:20:54,402 --> 00:20:57,303
Here many years before it can be like this.

230
00:20:58,273 --> 00:21:01,504
You can overcome bad weather, Colonel.

231
00:21:02,377 --> 00:21:05,403
HP decided to let the colonel.

232
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:09,407
I can not ride a helicopter.

233
00:21:16,324 --> 00:21:20,454
- Helicopter participation. Do you know why? - Why?

234
00:21:20,495 --> 00:21:22,292
Do they care?

235
00:21:22,497 --> 00:21:25,261
As a precaution, Brooks.

236
00:21:45,386 --> 00:21:47,320
We do?

237
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:48,482
There is nothing he can not face.

238
00:21:48,523 --> 00:21:52,254
- He is in charge. - He missed the bed? L miss my bed.

239
00:21:52,293 --> 00:21:53,385
Do you miss your bed?

240
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:56,388
It has a bed, Cole?

241
00:21:58,366 --> 00:21:59,526
It has a bed, right?

242
00:22:00,501 --> 00:22:02,401
See you at the meeting.

243
00:22:02,403 --> 00:22:04,234

246
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:30,226
- Machine? - I checked three times.

247
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:38,338
Leaders in Fox Fox Group. Time Griffin and ants.

248
00:22:38,373 --> 00:22:43,333
As always, do not forget ...... grip!

249
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:15,402
Maintenance of vision.

250
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,243
Fox five let you know when it closer.

251
00:23:19,447 --> 00:23:22,314
Location Fox Lima.

252
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,510

let's start!

255
00:23:41,502 --> 00:23:43,436
Maintenance direction.

256
00:23:43,538 --> 00:23:46,234
We have already done so.

257
00:23:46,507 --> 00:23:48,304
Benny expensive.

258
00:23:48,543 --> 00:23:52,309
Seen a hurricane decision ...

259
00:23:52,313 --> 00:23:54,304
Maybe fly?

260
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:56,314
This is what happens.

261
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:02,346
Sebaikanya grip.

262
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:30,383
The Fox Group is the group leader. Change to inertial navigation.

263
00:24:30,451 --> 00:24:33,420
Remember lcarus story ...

264
00:24:33,454 --> 00:24:36,446
His father gave wax wings ...

265
00:24:36,457 --> 00:24:39,392
He warned not to fly close to the sun.

266
00:24:39,427 --> 00:24:45,388
Akselarasinya drag ... so then flew more ...

267
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:48,334
Although his wings melted from the sun ...

268
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:51,328
And fell into the sea.

269
00:24:51,405 --> 00:24:55,432
The US military is not responsible.

270
00:24:55,443 --> 00:25:00,244
So they gave the material that we have made ...

271
00:25:00,281 --> 00:25:02,249
Baja Pennsylvania.

272
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,277

273
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,298
Come flying low.

Fox Seven, lower Landsat team.

276
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:53,351
So, head of Lima. Fox three to six fields.

277
00:26:53,394 --> 00:26:55,362
Let us there.

278
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,354
Other people keep up with the squad leader.

279
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:02,428
To bring the device to three hours. Come on, act now!

280
00:27:24,492 --> 00:27:27,359
Prepare earthquake explosives.

281
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,363
Understood.

282
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,266
Fox II scapegoat.

283
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:45,342
It is understood that Fox three. According to 0-9-0.

284
00:27:47,515 --> 00:27:49,449
You see what I see?

285
00:27:50,284 --> 00:27:54,345
Earthquake response is excellent.

286
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:06,264
You will not believe it.

287
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:10,235
Good luck!.

288
00:28:21,382 --> 00:28:23,316
Beware!

289
00:28:36,263 --> 00:28:38,288
Beware!

290

- Take us out of here! - Fox nine trap!

300
00:31:07,281 --> 00:31:10,444
Minimum check.

301
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,385
We will fall.

302
00:31:16,523 --> 00:31:22,359
Fox five, LT Leader Fox, Fox nine traps ... 1 kilomoeter north of the river.

303
00:31:22,363 --> 00:31:24,354
- Send Rescue. - Good.

304
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:27,231

Oh shit! I know.

310
00:32:06,407 --> 00:32:09,376
We die, you idiot.

311
00:32:18,452 --> 00:32:21,319

We will fall!

318
00:33:05,499 --> 00:33:08,263
Listen, I want you to tell me now.

319
00:33:08,268 --> 00:33:09,462

00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:28,246
Contact each unit! It aired?

322
00:34:28,282 --> 00:34:30,307
L repeat, do not launch?

323
00:34:30,517 --> 00:34:33,418
All will understand.

324
00:34:34,388 --> 00:34:36,288
We in the south of the island.

325
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,290
A river a few kilometers away.

326
00:34:38,325 --> 00:34:41,294
We follow the flow of water to the North Coast where prostitutes.

327
00:34:41,395 --> 00:34:44,228
What are you waiting for? All helicopter crash.

328

We must find a way to send a signal to the board, they will send search

329
00:34:47,468 --> 00:34:49,436
We just need to choose the right path.

330
00:34:50,404 --> 00:34:52,338
He should sit alone at the table.

331
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:54,364
Wait a minute, we are not talking about it?

332
00:34:54,441 --> 00:34:57,308
Our best people spread over 8 kilometers.

333
00:34:57,344 --> 00:34:59,403
We must go to the north and join the others.

334
00:34:59,413 --> 00:35:02,439
- Are you ok? - I can not claim to answer this question.

335
00:35:02,483 --> 00:35:06,283
- I do not know. - who are you?

336
00:35:06,386 --> 00:35:09,412
- I hope it was worth it. - I do not want to talk about it?

337
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:13,256
l is not normal, this will not happen.

338
00:35:14,495 --> 00:35:16,463

343
00:35:29,309 --> 00:35:30,435

Chapman, preserve jobs.

347
00:35:37,551 --> 00:35:40,281
We pick you up, but do not have enough ammunition

348
00:35:40,287 --> 00:35:41,481
The Sea Stallion biocides.

349

(SOUND STATlC)

351
00:35:47,427 --> 00:35:49,258
- Chapman. - (STATlC)

352
00:35:50,497 --> 00:35:53,466
Reles. Take a break, or you like to go?

353
00:35:54,334 --> 00:35:56,427
- I'm ready, sir. - Fast.

354
00:35:58,505 --> 00:36:02,236
Chapman in the chart cells. Look around you.

355
00:36:14,288 --> 00:36:17,451
Cole, what's wrong with you? Even now, I do not want to eat.

356
00:36:20,394 --> 00:36:22,362
Eating life.

357
00:36:22,396 --> 00:36:25,490
We just won the Apes building!

358
00:36:26,466 --> 00:36:28,263
Yes sir.

359
00:36:29,403 --> 00:36:31,496
It is not unusual.

360
00:36:32,406 --> 00:36:35,500
This is the brain?

361
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:40,312
No tactic Therefore, we do our best in this case.

362
00:36:42,516 --> 00:36:44,484
Cooperation

363
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:54,452
Thank God, you're right.

364
00:36:58,398 --> 00:37:00,366
- Nice to meet you, sir. - Good.

365
00:37:01,301 --> 00:37:04,361
- How many survived? - Seven survivors.

366
00:37:04,404 --> 00:37:06,395
Seven died in the mission.

367
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,236
Raf and Hodges.

368
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:12,403
The rest were missing.

369
00:37:27,427 --> 00:37:29,292
Where Landa in?

370
00:37:31,531 --> 00:37:33,431
How are you?

371
00:37:33,467 --> 00:37:36,231
- Okay thank you. - Good.

372
00:37:36,403 --> 00:37:38,394
I am glad to hear this news, I'm worried about you.

373
00:37:43,543 --> 00:37:48,344
You want to tell me everything, I do not know ......

374
00:37:48,448 --> 00:37:50,473
Or I'll shoot you in the head.

375
00:37:53,353 --> 00:37:55,321
Monster there.

376
00:37:55,522 --> 00:37:57,387
{0}Of course{/0} {1}!!{/1}

377
00:37:57,491 --> 00:37:59,482
No one believes.

378
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,353
LN Israel thought I was crazy.

379
00:38:03,297 --> 00:38:04,457
But today ...

380
00:38:04,531 --> 00:38:08,365
So it is not geological tasks.

381
00:38:08,468 --> 00:38:11,369
He dropped a bomb to lure something.

382
00:38:12,472 --> 00:38:16,203
- who are you? - Have you heard USS Lawton?

383
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,478
The public did not.

384
00:38:19,246 --> 00:38:23,273
Thousands of young people on board survived lake

385
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,248
They will be updated in the war ship sank family,

386
00:38:26,286 --> 00:38:29,414
But I know what I see, there is no conscience creatures.

387
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:33,325
There is no common sense, but devastating.

388
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,328
I spent the last 30 years,

389
00:38:35,362 --> 00:38:38,525
Trying to prove anything, I learned the truth that day.

390
00:38:39,499 --> 00:38:42,468
The planet is not ours.

391
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,534
Ancient species to rule the Earth

392
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:47,507
Long before the people.

393
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:52,274
If we do not care, they will not take it back.

394
00:38:52,412 --> 00:38:55,472
The agency is called the monarch, we love

395
00:38:55,482 --> 00:38:58,508
Unknown giant.

396
00:38:59,252 --> 00:39:01,243
You know that thing in here?

397
00:39:01,355 --> 00:39:05,223
I am very sad man, Colonel. Really.

398
00:39:06,293 --> 00:39:09,285
Take us home, and evidence.

399
00:39:10,297 --> 00:39:12,390
Therefore, we can send troops.

400
00:39:25,512 --> 00:39:27,480
L soldiers.

401
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:32,479
This is called the hollow Earth theory. Randa hire ...

402
00:39:33,286 --> 00:39:34,446
Because I write papers.

403
00:39:34,488 --> 00:39:38,288
It is considered crazy.

404
00:39:38,425 --> 00:39:42,259
That there is a large room in the basement ...

405
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:45,264
- Close on the surface. - aisle.

406
00:39:45,332 --> 00:39:48,301
Rand believed Island may be one of them.

407
00:39:48,301 --> 00:39:51,236
I would like to point out that no matter what below Yes.

408
00:39:51,338 --> 00:39:54,239
As we have just seen the ancient species.

409
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:56,298
I thought he was crazy.

410
00:39:57,344 --> 00:40:00,279
LT Slivka. Did you hear that? Others?

411
00:40:00,313 --> 00:40:02,372
We headed north town prostitutes.

412
00:40:02,382 --> 00:40:05,317
It all seemed too quiet.

413
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:09,250
- There is a hearing? anyone. - We're out of range, Slivka.

414
00:40:09,356 --> 00:40:10,323
"Fuck ! ! ! "

415
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:12,382
In addition, the approaches the group.

416
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:27,272
It can not be moved.

417
00:40:30,343 --> 00:40:32,243
Low noise

418
00:40:49,262 --> 00:40:51,321
- Slivka. - what?

419
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,464
Dalmatian.

420
00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:14,250
They did not die in vain.

421
00:41:14,488 --> 00:41:16,388
I swear!.

422
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:18,416
Their deaths ...

423
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:21,325
You will be rewarded.

424
00:41:25,432 --> 00:41:28,299
Chapman back to make ammunition.

425
00:41:36,376 --> 00:41:39,345
Have you heard of mice, lions, and thorns of the story?

426
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,374
- Yes. - That's him.

427
00:41:42,516 --> 00:41:44,484
Who would have thought that we would meet again primates.

428
00:41:45,485 --> 00:41:48,352
You know the story of the mice become friends

429
00:41:48,355 --> 00:41:51,256
After the lions mouse thorn out of their hands, right?

430
00:41:52,459 --> 00:41:54,256
Item

431
00:41:54,327 --> 00:41:56,352
The rats were killed thorn lion.

432
00:41:57,531 --> 00:41:59,465
Who told me, Cole?

433
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,265
my mother.

434
00:42:24,524 --> 00:42:26,492
- Damn! - Beware!

435
00:42:27,494 --> 00:42:30,258
- what? - Behind you!

436
00:42:30,397 --> 00:42:32,262
- Beware! - LN tree!

437
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,493
gun!

438
00:42:43,243 --> 00:42:44,369
I'll help you!

439
00:42:45,278 --> 00:42:46,506
I can not shoot!

440
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,317
Cut the legs!

441
00:43:20,246 --> 00:43:21,338
Beware!

442
00:43:45,405 --> 00:43:48,272
clam down! We moved!

443
00:43:52,512 --> 00:43:54,446
Maintain close contact.

444
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:01,453
What is this?

445
00:44:44,497 --> 00:44:46,465
Wow, behind you!

446
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,234
Low noise

447
00:44:49,502 --> 00:44:50,469
go back!

448
00:44:50,503 --> 00:44:52,471
- come back! - Friends.

449
00:44:53,373 --> 00:44:56,433
- Shoot. - take it easy.

450
00:45:08,521 --> 00:45:11,388
Do not shoot.

451
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:14,358
Everything is calm.

452
00:45:16,362 --> 00:45:17,420
"What?"

453
00:45:18,231 --> 00:45:20,290
I do not believe it when they told me to come.

454
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,394
I have not slept all night, I think

455
00:45:23,403 --> 00:45:25,496
And Gunpei how I dreamed this moment.

456
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:30,307
Now, this is happening. 28 years and 11 months.

457
00:45:30,376 --> 00:45:33,311
8 test does not return to the world ......

458
00:45:33,379 --> 00:45:35,370
The world come to me?

459
00:45:36,282 --> 00:45:38,216
It's OK, is not it?

460
00:45:39,285 --> 00:45:40,445
They never laugh.

461
00:45:41,454 --> 00:45:45,390
- are you here? - Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

462
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:48,325
Hank Captain Marlow, from 45 lnfantry.

463
00:45:49,295 --> 00:45:51,286
I fight for you.

464
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,493
You are so beautiful......

465
00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:00,271
From hot dogs and beer.

466
00:46:00,273 --> 00:46:03,242
On opening day at Wrigley Field.

467
00:46:09,482 --> 00:46:11,382
But you are real.

468
00:46:14,287 --> 00:46:15,345
correct?

469
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:19,449
I tell you. I told you, right?

470
00:46:19,459 --> 00:46:21,290
I protested.

471
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:23,329
'' It's OK. ''

472
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:25,524
Nice.

473
00:46:29,435 --> 00:46:33,428
- It is there. - There are many things out there.

474
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,308
Come on, we need to go home.

475
00:46:37,277 --> 00:46:39,336
You do not want it here in the evening.

476
00:49:35,521 --> 00:49:38,490
You probably already know that in this island there are many strange things.

477
00:49:39,492 --> 00:49:43,258
As long as we are here to accompany them, we'll be fine.

478
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:45,456
The walls were ...

479
00:49:45,465 --> 00:49:47,456
This is an animal, do not make?

480
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,367
No it does not enter blocked.

481
00:49:51,471 --> 00:49:52,495
"What?"

482
00:49:52,538 --> 00:49:56,269
They live in trees, under us.

483
00:49:56,342 --> 00:49:58,333
Some of them immature.

484
00:49:58,511 --> 00:50:01,412
There is no crime. No private property.

485
00:50:02,281 --> 00:50:03,475
They do not care about all this.

486
00:50:15,328 --> 00:50:16,386
Best regards.

487
00:50:16,396 --> 00:50:18,296
Best regards.

488
00:50:19,265 --> 00:50:20,425
So, good news.

489
00:50:21,234 --> 00:50:22,496
You say you can sleep here.

490
00:50:24,437 --> 00:50:26,405
You can not hear you speak.

491
00:50:26,439 --> 00:50:28,407
They rarely speak.

492
00:50:28,474 --> 00:50:31,443
If you're here, you'll understand.

493
00:50:31,511 --> 00:50:34,275
- let us wait and see. - Wait.

494
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,441
We could not stay. We have to leave here,

495
00:50:36,482 --> 00:50:37,506
our life.

496
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:40,485
- Life? - Yes, not now, okay?

497
00:50:41,287 --> 00:50:43,346
Who landed here, stays here.

498
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:49,519
As far as I know, burn washed ashore about 10 years, he has done before l.

499
00:50:49,529 --> 00:50:51,520
You are here from '44?

500
00:50:51,531 --> 00:50:54,329
Yes. What happened during the war? We win?

501
00:50:54,434 --> 00:50:56,265
"What?"

502
00:50:56,502 --> 00:50:58,402
This makes sense.

503
00:50:59,338 --> 00:51:03,297
This is their refuge. If damage your hands, do not touch anything.

504
00:51:18,491 --> 00:51:20,356
check it out.

505
00:51:34,373 --> 00:51:37,274
According to their story, thousands of years,

506
00:51:37,276 --> 00:51:39,369
Islanders live in fear.

507
00:51:40,513 --> 00:51:43,277
This fear is a very long time.

508
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:49,386
Then one day, the most surprising thing.

509
00:51:50,323 --> 00:51:52,291
They are afraid,

510
00:51:52,291 --> 00:51:55,260
Start protecting them from consuming them.

511
00:51:57,363 --> 00:51:59,388
But I think nothing is eternal.

512
00:52:05,538 --> 00:52:09,235
Here they respect their last city.

513
00:52:16,282 --> 00:52:17,408
Yes sir.

514
00:52:18,351 --> 00:52:20,285
This area.

515
00:52:23,422 --> 00:52:25,356
He's here.

516
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,428
For them, he was a god.

517
00:52:31,497 --> 00:52:33,431
King Kong well.

518
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:36,301
He is a lonely man.

519
00:52:38,504 --> 00:52:41,530
This is his home. We were the only guests.

520
00:52:44,277 --> 00:52:46,336
Someone you do not come home ...

521
00:52:46,379 --> 00:52:49,314
Unless you ask war dropping bombs.

522
00:52:49,515 --> 00:52:52,484
Wasnt Hong Kong who killed your friend?

523
00:52:53,486 --> 00:52:55,317
Item

524
00:52:56,389 --> 00:52:58,254
one of them.

525
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:01,383
Keep Hong Kong Island.

526
00:53:02,328 --> 00:53:04,421
But the devil live in our feet.

527
00:53:06,332 --> 00:53:08,266
What are they called it?

528
00:53:09,435 --> 00:53:12,233
lwis not want to mention his name.

529
00:53:12,371 --> 00:53:14,532
But I put it prostrate skull.

530
00:53:15,341 --> 00:53:18,367
- Why? - Because it sounds cool.

531
00:53:21,314 --> 00:53:23,475
- Ok. - To name.

532
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:26,411
- I want to scare you. - Do not bother with this name.

533
00:53:26,452 --> 00:53:30,218
- Do you mind? I liked the name - yes, that's good.

534
00:53:30,256 --> 00:53:33,384
Do not say that, it sounds silly names.

535
00:53:34,293 --> 00:53:35,487
LT- you want to give him a call.

536
00:53:36,329 --> 00:53:38,490
Big lizard. Malignant.

537
00:53:39,532 --> 00:53:44,231
He is from the ground, which is why Hong Kong angry.

538
00:53:46,405 --> 00:53:48,430
They wake up the bomb.

539
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:55,344
I want to tell you, you are happy to come here,

540
00:53:55,348 --> 00:53:57,316
Otherwise you will not get in here.

541
00:53:58,351 --> 00:54:01,286
Cunning, very difficult.

542
00:54:06,425 --> 00:54:09,485
Hong Kong can play them when they are very young.

543
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,325
You do not want to wake up super.

544
00:54:16,335 --> 00:54:18,360
- how many. - Over.

545
00:54:18,371 --> 00:54:20,339
He killed his family to Hong Kong.

546
00:54:20,439 --> 00:54:23,306
Kong is the last, but it continues to grow.

547
00:54:23,376 --> 00:54:27,278
You better hope he grows up, because lwis said Hong Kong dead ...

548
00:54:27,446 --> 00:54:29,437
Great will increase.

549
00:54:31,284 --> 00:54:33,377
Then, everything was destroyed.

550
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:38,516
This is not to say that the three-day North Island feed.

551
00:54:39,392 --> 00:54:42,486
- You must come with us. - Northern part of the island?

552
00:54:44,297 --> 00:54:46,288
- We should get out of here. --3 Days within?

553
00:54:46,365 --> 00:54:48,230
Yes sir.

554
00:54:53,472 --> 00:54:56,305
You can reach the northern end of three days.

555
00:54:56,375 --> 00:54:59,310
Among them, it is impossible.

556
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:05,384
Do not go.

557
00:55:30,476 --> 00:55:33,309
This is an ugly bird.

558
00:55:49,328 --> 00:55:52,354
Damn. This place is hell.

559
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,300
Monster there.

560
00:55:56,369 --> 00:55:58,360
We paid for it.

561
00:55:59,405 --> 00:56:02,340
- bring it on. - Looks like maybe he would kill

562
00:56:02,341 --> 00:56:04,309
Monkey we are not out of here? Yes.

563
00:56:04,343 --> 00:56:06,334
- what should we do? - Yes, where is it?

564
00:56:06,345 --> 00:56:08,438
Evacuation point. We should arrive within three days.

565
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:10,312
We will. Better get up.

566
00:56:10,349 --> 00:56:13,250
- How to Chapman ... - If the colonel says he came,

567
00:56:13,285 --> 00:56:14,274
He will come.

568
00:56:20,259 --> 00:56:21,521
We almost do its job.

569
00:56:22,261 --> 00:56:25,321
Gunpai want to go back to the sea.

570
00:56:25,364 --> 00:56:27,389
So they killed him.

571
00:56:29,535 --> 00:56:31,435
Yes.

572
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,380
this is very good.

573
00:56:46,285 --> 00:56:47,411
This is real.

574
00:56:55,428 --> 00:56:57,396
Where I can float?

575
00:56:57,496 --> 00:57:01,330
I Gunpei set them for six years.

576
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,491
His name is gray fox.

577
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:06,204
It floats.

578
00:57:14,447 --> 00:57:16,415
From aircraft engines M-51 mines,

579
00:57:16,449 --> 00:57:18,314
Its zero.

580
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:20,477
I found on the beach B-29. This is great.

581
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:24,478
You must be joking. To tetanus.

582
00:57:25,524 --> 00:57:29,483
I know it's bad. But it can, if it helps increase.

583
00:57:30,296 --> 00:57:33,231
Unless you have a better idea, I suggest you start working.

584
00:57:35,301 --> 00:57:36,427
Good!

585
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:09,454
wake up!

586
00:59:10,529 --> 00:59:13,293
All right.

587
01:00:22,434 --> 01:00:23,492
Wow.

588
01:00:24,336 --> 01:00:26,304
check it out.

589
01:00:26,338 --> 01:00:28,306
This is bloody!

590
01:00:30,509 --> 01:00:32,443
Those of us who do.

591
01:00:32,544 --> 01:00:38,244
We are looking for Chapman, there are plenty of ammunition in the Sea Stallion crashed,

592
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,275
Do not kill him.

593
01:00:48,293 --> 01:00:49,351
unbelievable.

594
01:00:50,262 --> 01:00:52,526
What I would do, instead of F-16?

595
01:00:55,267 --> 01:00:57,462
l Vietnamese People's Army fought farmer who came from.

596
01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:00,363
After he gave up, we destroyed the village.

597
01:01:00,506 --> 01:01:04,272
He was 60 years old, he was wearing when we arrived.

598
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,310
sometimes...

599
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:08,403
Enemy no.

600
01:01:09,448 --> 01:01:11,416
When you're looking for it.

601
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:15,353
What happens when they appear?

602
01:01:15,387 --> 01:01:17,355
I have a gun.

603
01:01:19,291 --> 01:01:21,316
Good luck, soldier.

604
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:35,365
Okay, so we have the north coast 48 hours.

605
01:01:35,407 --> 01:01:37,466
- Do you know what you're doing? - Yes.

606
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:40,505
My father was a mechanic. If they can not fix my father will not be happy.

607
01:01:41,547 --> 01:01:44,243
LF I saw on again.

608
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:48,318
Wait. Russia is our ally.

609
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:52,220
- We are at war with them? - It is cold.

610
01:01:52,324 --> 01:01:54,224
Do you think the Cold War ...

611
01:01:54,326 --> 01:01:56,294
After the summer?

612
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:01,262
Cubs win the World Cup?

613
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,301
- Bear? - number

614
01:02:04,369 --> 01:02:07,361
- Are they good? - They are my favorite. where are you from?

615
01:02:07,406 --> 01:02:09,397
- Detroit. - Ok.

616
01:02:09,441 --> 01:02:11,500
So Tiger win?

617
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:14,279
- I do not know. - I doubt it.

618
01:02:14,513 --> 01:02:16,344
LTTE cubs.

619
01:02:16,381 --> 01:02:19,316
Who do you think wins, tiger or bear children?

620
01:02:19,451 --> 01:02:21,419
Absolute tiger.

621
01:02:22,354 --> 01:02:24,481
Yes, because the bear was a baby.

622
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:28,225
Adult tiger can eat Baby Bear.

623
01:02:29,294 --> 01:02:30,522
You need to think twice.

624
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:34,526
I also put a man on the moon.

625
01:02:35,367 --> 01:02:38,461
is it serious? I left him a man?

626
01:02:39,371 --> 01:02:41,464
- What is to eat what? - Kang.

627
01:02:42,441 --> 01:02:44,375
spam.

628
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:48,309
Come on, this evening.

629
01:02:54,453 --> 01:02:57,320
Fox, Chapman replaced.

630
01:02:58,290 --> 01:03:00,349
Fox, Chapman replaced.

631
01:03:11,436 --> 01:03:13,404
Billy dear ...

632
01:03:14,406 --> 01:03:17,307
Sometimes it is difficult for you.

633
01:04:07,459 --> 01:04:09,427
What kind of music?

634
01:04:10,395 --> 01:04:13,296
What happened to swing? Barry Goodman.

635
01:04:13,532 --> 01:04:15,500
You're like a time traveler.

636
01:04:15,534 --> 01:04:18,367
This is modern music.

637
01:04:25,377 --> 01:04:28,278
I do not know what they thought, I have to face behind a beard.

638
01:04:28,313 --> 01:04:31,441
I really hope we can take the boat for 36 hours at upstream.

639
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:34,283
Because if we're late ...

640
01:04:34,353 --> 01:04:36,321
He graduated from our history.

641
01:04:37,289 --> 01:04:39,416
When he wrote l timeshare around the earth empty ...

642
01:04:39,491 --> 01:04:42,255
Laughing entire board.

643
01:04:42,394 --> 01:04:44,259
Miranda is not.

644
01:04:44,296 --> 01:04:47,322
I take seriously the only person who.

645
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:49,263
feel good.

646
01:04:49,301 --> 01:04:51,496
Then I thought he was crazy, he told me that there is full of monsters.

647
01:04:52,537 --> 01:04:54,471
I do not know when I'm talking,

648
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:56,441
- I still do not speak. - Are you saying that.

649
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:58,443
- right? - Yes. - I said?

650
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:00,501
- Yes. - His mouth moving.

651
01:05:00,545 --> 01:05:04,276
- what? - I'll stab you tonight.

652
01:05:04,316 --> 01:05:07,342
- is that true? - just joking.

653
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,482
If the ship is not working properly, take the train.

654
01:05:15,327 --> 01:05:16,453
Strange, is not it?

655
01:05:17,329 --> 01:05:20,230
The most dangerous place is always the most beautiful places.

656
01:05:20,399 --> 01:05:23,368
I hope to have a long-exposure photograph, but ...

657
01:05:23,435 --> 01:05:25,369
Fault light.

658
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:27,370
Oh, ah ...

659
01:05:28,307 --> 01:05:30,502
- Try this. - thank you.

660
01:05:33,278 --> 01:05:35,371
- British Airways? - my father.

661
01:05:35,447 --> 01:05:39,281
He took me from the car when it goes against the Nazis.

662
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:42,282
For me, he is like John Wayne.

663
01:05:42,387 --> 01:05:44,412
Like a fairy tale hero.

664
01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:49,249
- When does he come back? - Airplane crash in Hamburg.

665
01:05:49,461 --> 01:05:52,225
They looked for him for months, but ......

666
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,267
I do not think this was a general feeling.

667
01:05:59,371 --> 01:06:01,339
thorough.

668
01:06:09,448 --> 01:06:12,315
Hey, do not waste time, check the perimeter.

669
01:06:23,328 --> 01:06:24,522
Packard Colonel ...

670
01:06:26,365 --> 01:06:28,492
Mission in the fall ...

671
01:06:29,301 --> 01:06:30,529
This is a great idea.

672
01:06:31,436 --> 01:06:33,495
I know you are looking for your boy.

673
01:06:35,273 --> 01:06:37,264
Or rest.

674
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:40,301
It is beyond our means.

675
01:06:41,313 --> 01:06:43,372
I do not like the way liters of leadership?

676
01:06:44,383 --> 01:06:46,317
Please go.

677
01:06:48,253 --> 01:06:51,313
When do you put this place on the map you how to do it.

678
01:06:51,356 --> 01:06:54,382
I will not stop.

679
01:06:56,461 --> 01:06:59,259
I know where the enemy, when I see it.

680
01:07:29,261 --> 01:07:31,491
His name Gunpei lkari.

681
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:38,230
If we get rid of uniforms ...

682
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:40,461
And war ...

683
01:07:40,505 --> 01:07:42,439
He became my brother.

684
01:07:45,343 --> 01:07:48,210
He promised not to leave each other.

685
01:07:54,453 --> 01:07:56,421
Let us leave this island.

686
01:08:06,264 --> 01:08:08,425
- Wait! - Set the hose. - Yes.

687
01:08:09,301 --> 01:08:11,235
Fast, come on!

688
01:08:11,403 --> 01:08:13,337
Continue

689
01:08:20,245 --> 01:08:22,270
Three definitely a success! Come on!

690
01:08:22,547 --> 01:08:25,277
Come on!

691
01:08:28,353 --> 01:08:29,513
Yes sir.

692
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:35,350
Great!

693
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,250
I think this is goodbye.

694
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:07,324
Best regards.

695
01:09:16,401 --> 01:09:19,268
If you are in Chicago, looking for me.

696
01:10:50,362 --> 01:10:52,387
Let me help you.

697
01:10:54,232 --> 01:10:55,324
Men should do.

698
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:58,401
Are you ok? - Yes.

699
01:10:58,403 --> 01:10:59,427
Let me go.

700
01:11:00,472 --> 01:11:02,303
You see me in the library.

701
01:11:05,443 --> 01:11:06,375
I have a wife.

702
01:11:07,312 --> 01:11:08,279
I have a wife.

703
01:11:08,313 --> 01:11:10,213
But I have a wife?

704
01:11:11,316 --> 01:11:13,250
I couldn’t tell.

705
01:11:14,452 --> 01:11:16,317
There, he served as the Lake

706
01:11:17,322 --> 01:11:19,381
From his telegram, the day before he fell lake

707
01:11:19,424 --> 01:11:21,392
He told me to get the boy.

708
01:11:21,393 --> 01:11:23,293
I have a son there.

709
01:11:23,461 --> 01:11:25,452
Men do not recognize.

710
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:27,521
She thought you were dead.

711
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:29,460
I'm fine.

712
01:11:30,502 --> 01:11:32,299
What Naoko, etc.?

713
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:34,335
I'm fine.

714
01:11:36,241 --> 01:11:38,402
I just want a chance to meet them.

715
01:11:39,477 --> 01:11:41,206
This is enough.

716
01:11:42,347 --> 01:11:43,439
We'll send you home.

717
01:11:43,515 --> 01:11:46,279
Fox pet answer. Is anyone here?

718
01:11:46,284 --> 01:11:48,445
Yes, Fox five, we can hear.

719
01:11:48,486 --> 01:11:50,283
Yes, we are on the boat.

720
01:11:50,322 --> 01:11:52,449
- To the north of the river. - ferry?

721
01:11:52,490 --> 01:11:55,459
I can get it where? We encountered a crazy Santa Claus

722
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:58,224
Over time, you'll meet him.

723
01:11:58,229 --> 01:11:59,287
What ship?

724
01:11:59,331 --> 01:12:01,356
More like an airplane weighing boat.

725
01:12:01,399 --> 01:12:02,423
Called 'Boats'

726
01:12:02,467 --> 01:12:03,456
We boarded the boat.

727
01:12:03,501 --> 01:12:05,332
Keeping an eye on them, Slivka.

728
01:12:05,337 --> 01:12:07,305
Fired flares. We can find you.

729
01:12:08,273 --> 01:12:09,433
Fox pet.

730
01:12:09,441 --> 01:12:11,238
Remove the lens!

731
01:12:17,282 --> 01:12:18,340
Ay.

732
01:12:18,516 --> 01:12:21,485
We've seen two kilometers north.

733
01:12:21,519 --> 01:12:24,249
Fox five, Fox is one of them.

734
01:12:24,522 --> 01:12:27,491
Meet for an hour.

735
01:12:27,525 --> 01:12:29,288
get ready!

736
01:12:29,294 --> 01:12:30,283
You can enter?

737
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:33,490
Ay.

738
01:12:33,498 --> 01:12:35,398
We go home!

739
01:12:41,306 --> 01:12:42,364
Get off the truck

740
01:12:52,283 --> 01:12:54,251
What is hell?

741
01:12:54,252 --> 01:12:55,310
He was killed.

742
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:58,412
Put your device, we must continue.

743
01:12:59,324 --> 01:13:01,224
HP station encountered.

744
01:13:01,259 --> 01:13:02,419
No, wait!

745
01:13:02,527 --> 01:13:05,325
Nobody wants to talk about ...... this.

746
01:13:06,364 --> 01:13:08,423
He will not come back. There's nothing to talk about.

747
01:13:11,503 --> 01:13:13,266
Oh!

748
01:13:17,475 --> 01:13:20,308
They have only two kilometers north.

749
01:13:21,312 --> 01:13:22,279
Soon they arrive.

750
01:13:22,547 --> 01:13:25,516
Unless you eat something bigger than us.

751
01:13:33,391 --> 01:13:35,325
Oh my!

752
01:13:35,326 --> 01:13:36,486
Slivko!

753
01:13:37,495 --> 01:13:39,463
I never thought to see you again.

754
01:13:39,497 --> 01:13:41,488
- I think they're crazy. - I hope I'm crazy.

755
01:13:41,499 --> 01:13:43,490
How many people left? look...

756
01:13:44,269 --> 01:13:45,327
This is my stuff.

757
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:46,359
A person's loss.

758
01:13:46,404 --> 01:13:47,462
glad to meet you.

759
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:49,498
Who is it?

760
01:13:50,341 --> 01:13:51,399
A passenger.

761
01:13:51,476 --> 01:13:55,242
Hank will Marlow Kuadron Hunter 15 45

762
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,271
You are here since the Second World War?

763
01:13:57,282 --> 01:13:59,409
Yes, I miss the parade?

764
01:14:00,251 --> 01:14:01,377
Oh!

765
01:14:01,419 --> 01:14:03,353
Sincerely, Lieutenant.

766
01:14:03,421 --> 01:14:04,445
We'll take you home, sir.

767
01:14:05,423 --> 01:14:06,481
We follow the river ...

768
01:14:06,491 --> 01:14:09,221
Our ship will arrive on the North Shore.

769
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:10,420
this is very good.

770
01:14:10,462 --> 01:14:12,396
But we did not go.

771
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:14,330
Nothing is left here, Conrad.

772
01:14:14,499 --> 01:14:16,364
It still?

773
01:14:16,401 --> 01:14:17,265
Parkman.

774
01:14:17,302 --> 01:14:19,429
He's here at sea species Marcy.

775
01:14:19,471 --> 01:14:21,496
West? We can not go west!

776
01:14:21,506 --> 01:14:23,474
The residence is the place of the skull.

777
01:14:23,508 --> 01:14:26,409
There's an old saying: " 'East, west difference!' '

778
01:14:26,411 --> 01:14:27,435
This is what we say!

779
01:14:27,479 --> 01:14:29,413
Southwest

780
01:14:29,481 --> 01:14:31,346
We can consider it.

781
01:14:31,382 --> 01:14:34,283
We have a lot of weapons, if you want to go west.

782
01:14:34,352 --> 01:14:37,321
You must listen to Mallory.

783
01:14:37,522 --> 01:14:39,456
This is crazy.

784
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:42,291
He he.

785
01:14:42,427 --> 01:14:45,487
Yourjob find those who are missing, right?

786
01:14:49,467 --> 01:14:51,230
Good morning sir.

787
01:14:51,369 --> 01:14:54,236
But if he is not in that position ...

788
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,503
No search party, we returned in the evening, you know?

789
01:14:56,541 --> 01:14:59,408
Within 24 hours should not be next to the house.

790
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:01,469
Good. I know.

791
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:05,374
You heard him. We leave for 10 minutes.

792
01:15:05,416 --> 01:15:07,281
Nice Group.

793
01:15:07,318 --> 01:15:09,377
You want to die here together.

794
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:12,355
You are a good team, die together.

795
01:15:13,491 --> 01:15:15,425
You should not come here.

796
01:15:16,261 --> 01:15:18,422
It is a bad idea.

797
01:15:18,463 --> 01:15:20,431
It is a bad idea.

798
01:15:58,269 --> 01:15:59,327
Do you smell it?

799
01:15:59,404 --> 01:16:01,372
It was the smell of death.

800
01:16:04,409 --> 01:16:06,468
What is this place?

801
01:16:06,477 --> 01:16:09,275
Among them, the remaining parent concessions.

802
01:16:09,447 --> 01:16:13,383
I often pictures of mass graves, is one of them.

803
01:16:13,384 --> 01:16:15,511
And this hollow valley.

804
01:16:16,287 --> 01:16:18,448
We will go to the highest point of the west.

805
01:16:18,489 --> 01:16:20,354
Item

806
01:16:20,358 --> 01:16:23,293
This place is not good, sir.

807
01:16:23,294 --> 01:16:25,319
We need to go north.

808
01:16:25,363 --> 01:16:27,422
Please friends.

809
01:16:27,465 --> 01:16:29,296
Alone.

810
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:33,402
I do not want to leave Jack. Who am I?

811
01:16:34,472 --> 01:16:35,461
We can succeed.

812
01:16:35,506 --> 01:16:37,303
of course can.

813
01:16:37,442 --> 01:16:40,240
be careful.

814
01:16:44,315 --> 01:16:46,476
I'm new here 28 years I know what?

815
01:17:21,285 --> 01:17:22,343
Cole ...

816
01:17:22,387 --> 01:17:24,412
We do not have time. Close your cigarettes.

817
01:17:38,369 --> 01:17:40,496
Gas Note!

818
01:17:41,539 --> 01:17:42,506
This is stupid.

819
01:17:46,511 --> 01:17:49,275
We must go!

820
01:17:57,522 --> 01:17:58,489
Run!

821
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:04,319
where to!

822
01:18:10,268 --> 01:18:11,235
Complete silence.

823
01:19:04,288 --> 01:19:06,256
let us go.

824
01:19:06,324 --> 01:19:07,416
follow me.

825
01:19:09,393 --> 01:19:11,418
let's go together!

826
01:19:12,263 --> 01:19:14,527
Continue on civilians eyes. Come on!

827
01:19:28,412 --> 01:19:29,436
"Fuck ! ! ! "

828
01:19:32,483 --> 01:19:33,450
Relic!

829
01:19:41,459 --> 01:19:43,393
50 caliber rifle!

830
01:20:21,499 --> 01:20:25,230
I will lose more than honor and death.

831
01:20:29,407 --> 01:20:30,465
Come on!

832
01:20:50,461 --> 01:20:53,396
Tim flamethrower! Carry out your duty!

833
01:21:16,254 --> 01:21:17,221
Slivko!

834
01:21:17,355 --> 01:21:18,413
Gas

835
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:19,480
Toxic gases.

836
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:39,273
Mallory! sword!

837
01:22:03,334 --> 01:22:04,460
Slivka, survive!

838
01:22:11,475 --> 01:22:13,306
Let's fast!

839
01:22:43,341 --> 01:22:44,399
Listen, Colonel.

840
01:22:45,443 --> 01:22:47,274
The higher your rank ...

841
01:22:48,346 --> 01:22:50,337
However, I am no longer here.

842
01:22:51,248 --> 01:22:52,340
I will tell you..

843
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:55,514
This animal is only the first.

844
01:22:56,454 --> 01:22:58,354
We are in his territory ...

845
01:22:58,489 --> 01:23:00,320
We should soon!

846
01:23:01,459 --> 01:23:03,484
No, as long as Chapman still there.

847
01:23:03,527 --> 01:23:05,392
I'm sorry, Colonel Packard.

848
01:23:07,264 --> 01:23:08,424
Chapman was dead.

849
01:23:15,473 --> 01:23:17,270
It does not change anything.

850
01:23:17,341 --> 01:23:19,366
We have not lowered position.

851
01:23:19,377 --> 01:23:22,437
- What are you doing here? - Weapon!

852
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,414
Enough to kill him.

853
01:23:24,448 --> 01:23:26,348
LT kill Chapman.

854
01:23:26,350 --> 01:23:27,476
Well, it's killing them!

855
01:23:28,486 --> 01:23:30,283
my people!

856
01:23:30,521 --> 01:23:32,386
You can not kill the gang.

857
01:23:32,523 --> 01:23:34,354
Port on the island of God.

858
01:23:34,392 --> 01:23:37,259
Only those who hold the animals underground lizard.

859
01:23:37,294 --> 01:23:39,489
He was right, Colonel. We can not kill the gang.

860
01:23:39,497 --> 01:23:41,328
Other beings?

861
01:23:41,432 --> 01:23:44,458
This is a threat to their numbers.

862
01:23:44,502 --> 01:23:48,461
If you kill an opponent ...... he can not control.

863
01:23:48,506 --> 01:23:50,235
We killed them too!

864
01:23:50,408 --> 01:23:52,433
After that, we kill this.

865
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:54,470
I can not let Colonel.

866
01:23:54,478 --> 01:23:56,378
Wait! Do not shoot!

867
01:23:59,450 --> 01:24:03,386
- We will not lose the war. - Crazy!

868
01:24:03,521 --> 01:24:05,512
Did you hear that? This is crazy!

869
01:24:05,523 --> 01:24:08,287
You should listen to us!

870
01:24:08,292 --> 01:24:09,486
We are not at war, Colonel. you are wrong!

871
01:24:09,527 --> 01:24:11,392
Your soldiers are dying because they are lying!

872
01:24:11,429 --> 01:24:14,398
- Do you want us to die. - It's not our job.

873
01:24:15,366 --> 01:24:18,494
- Whose side are you on, sir? - Oh, Colonel.

874
01:24:19,437 --> 01:24:22,372
You are looking for a stallion on the rocks three kilometers.

875
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,435
I put this civil Wara back to the ship.

876
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:27,470
We are waiting for you there.

877
01:24:28,479 --> 01:24:29,411
Do you agree?

878
01:24:45,429 --> 01:24:47,226
Let's go!

879
01:24:47,431 --> 01:24:49,262
Let's kill this guy!

880
01:24:55,372 --> 01:24:56,339
Steve ...

881
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:58,465
You want to get into action or silence?

882
01:25:00,344 --> 01:25:01,504
I will not say anything.

883
01:25:02,379 --> 01:25:03,403
Marlowe, are you okay?

884
01:25:04,548 --> 01:25:06,311
We must stop him.

885
01:25:06,317 --> 01:25:10,253
They convince him? This is consistent determination.

886
01:25:10,321 --> 01:25:11,413
He was so furious.

887
01:25:13,524 --> 01:25:15,253
follow me......

888
01:25:15,526 --> 01:25:17,426
We'll go live.

889
01:25:23,334 --> 01:25:28,294
I want to go home for you and your mother.

890
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,271
Courage.

891
01:25:32,409 --> 01:25:33,467
I love you.

892
01:25:41,318 --> 01:25:43,377
Ensure families get it.

893
01:25:45,322 --> 01:25:46,311
Billy dear ...

894
01:25:49,326 --> 01:25:51,385
We are the best fighters.

895
01:25:59,503 --> 01:26:01,368
It was close.

896
01:26:02,306 --> 01:26:04,365
What have you lost? By what?

897
01:26:05,442 --> 01:26:07,273
There are many similar questions and so on.

898
01:26:21,258 --> 01:26:22,282
Wait here.

899
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:25,285
I have to go to the river.

900
01:26:27,398 --> 01:26:29,491
Hey. I'm coming along.

901
01:26:30,467 --> 01:26:32,367
I'll wait here.

902
01:26:35,372 --> 01:26:37,203
Take care and 9600880

903
01:26:38,309 --> 01:26:40,209
Also note the trees.

904
01:26:40,444 --> 01:26:41,411
What accounts for that?

905
01:26:42,279 --> 01:26:43,303
ant.

906
01:26:44,315 --> 01:26:45,373
Large ants.

907
01:26:46,517 --> 01:26:48,246
This is one.

908
01:26:49,386 --> 01:26:51,479
It sounds like a bird, but it is ants.

909
01:27:01,265 --> 01:27:04,462
Collect as many as you can, including earthquakes bomb.

910
01:27:05,402 --> 01:27:07,393
Mommy.

911
01:27:18,349 --> 01:27:19,407
Mills, Cole ...

912
01:27:19,516 --> 01:27:21,279
Setting explosives.

913
01:27:21,452 --> 01:27:24,319
Give him a special gift napalm.

914
01:27:54,385 --> 01:27:56,353
They have certainly been an explosion.

915
01:29:47,331 --> 01:29:49,390
We have to go. just now.

916
01:30:20,264 --> 01:30:21,288
Do not shoot!

917
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,265
Commander, we are in what direction?

918
01:30:25,436 --> 01:30:28,428
The three of you back to the ship. Through here.

919
01:30:28,439 --> 01:30:30,270
Wait until morning.

920
01:30:30,307 --> 01:30:32,275
LF will not go back ......

921
01:30:32,443 --> 01:30:33,410
Where..

922
01:30:33,444 --> 01:30:35,309
There is no need to be told twice.

923
01:30:35,379 --> 01:30:36,403
Where are you headed?

924
01:30:38,348 --> 01:30:39,508
We want to save Hong Kong.

925
01:30:41,251 --> 01:30:42,479
Without me, man.

926
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:47,299
soldiers!

927
01:32:47,411 --> 01:32:48,435
Prepare peledakmu.

928
01:32:49,546 --> 01:32:51,377
Now is the time to show the Congo ...

929
01:32:51,481 --> 01:32:54,416
The man is king!

930
01:32:55,485 --> 01:32:57,510
Interject. Turn two.

931
01:32:58,455 --> 01:32:59,422
Atifkan three.

932
01:33:02,292 --> 01:33:03,316
HP!

933
01:33:09,366 --> 01:33:10,333
Failure to do so.

934
01:33:14,538 --> 01:33:17,234
This feeling pretty good at the beginning.

935
01:33:17,374 --> 01:33:19,308
We do not want war, Hewlett-Packard.

936
01:33:19,309 --> 01:33:21,402
The creature we disappointed! He killed my man!

937
01:33:21,445 --> 01:33:23,413
Hong Kong to protect the territory.

938
01:33:23,447 --> 01:33:25,347
We are soldiers!

939
01:33:25,449 --> 01:33:27,280
We do the dirty work ...

940
01:33:27,317 --> 01:33:30,252
Thus, families and our people should not be afraid!

941
01:33:30,354 --> 01:33:33,448
They may not know of the existence of creatures like!

942
01:33:34,358 --> 01:33:35,382
He was furious.

943
01:33:38,462 --> 01:33:40,396
Blowing trigger.

944
01:33:54,511 --> 01:33:55,500
Stop!

945
01:34:00,317 --> 01:34:02,285
Greater than this world.

946
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:04,378
serious!

947
01:34:04,521 --> 01:34:07,354
Slivka, destroy it!

948
01:34:09,459 --> 01:34:11,484
What did you do wrong, son.

949
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:31,472
Down, sir.

950
01:34:32,382 --> 01:34:33,349
HP!

951
01:34:43,527 --> 01:34:45,256
Come on!

952
01:34:45,429 --> 01:34:46,418
There.

953
01:35:01,378 --> 01:35:02,345
There are greater.

954
01:35:02,479 --> 01:35:03,446
return

955
01:35:06,483 --> 01:35:07,472
Quick!

956
01:35:16,493 --> 01:35:17,517
Colonel.

957
01:35:19,362 --> 01:35:20,260
Sir!

958
01:35:39,516 --> 01:35:42,280
You're dead, asshole!

959
01:35:57,367 --> 01:35:58,459
Do not lose. Come on!

960
01:36:04,274 --> 01:36:05,366
They told me to go at dawn.

961
01:36:05,408 --> 01:36:06,397
- I know. - This is the dawn.

962
01:36:06,409 --> 01:36:07,376
I got it

963
01:36:07,377 --> 01:36:08,401
So how?

964
01:36:21,291 --> 01:36:22,349
The end of the island.

965
01:36:23,326 --> 01:36:26,261
Weaver, climb rocks and launching rockets.

966
01:36:26,363 --> 01:36:27,489
If you are lucky, you will see it.

967
01:36:30,367 --> 01:36:31,425
Do not delay.

968
01:36:33,470 --> 01:36:35,233
By this way.

969
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:49,509
Come on, every minute counts.

970
01:36:56,393 --> 01:36:58,520
Cole! We had to retreat.

971
01:36:59,462 --> 01:37:00,429
End your life.

972
01:37:01,298 --> 01:37:02,322
Get out.

973
01:37:04,301 --> 01:37:07,236
- Cole, do not! - Cole!

974
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:09,534
- Cole, do not! - stop!

975
01:37:09,539 --> 01:37:12,372
- Cole! - Cole! Cole!

976
01:37:12,375 --> 01:37:15,242
Do not! Do not!

977
01:37:15,545 --> 01:37:17,240
Cole!

978
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:23,447
Come on, asshole.

979
01:37:49,379 --> 01:37:51,347
Go for it! Cheers!

980
01:39:52,268 --> 01:39:53,496
Go for it! Cheers!

981
01:39:55,438 --> 01:39:57,463
Cole! fast!

982
01:40:05,348 --> 01:40:06,315
Come on!

983
01:40:14,424 --> 01:40:17,393
- Marlowe, help me! - He is hot, be careful!

984
01:41:13,483 --> 01:41:15,474
- of course! - of course!

985
01:41:18,354 --> 01:41:20,322
Come on, motherfucker!

986
01:42:17,313 --> 01:42:18,507
Weaver!

987
01:44:05,421 --> 01:44:06,479
He he.

988
01:44:08,291 --> 01:44:09,383
You are wrong.

989
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:05,404
So how do you see?

990
01:45:06,316 --> 01:45:07,442
West main road?

991
01:45:08,518 --> 01:45:10,418
I think, my friend.

992
01:45:11,487 --> 01:45:13,284
This place will change.

993
01:45:14,457 --> 01:45:16,220
This message will spread.

994
01:45:16,392 --> 01:45:17,484
Constantly.

995
01:45:18,394 --> 01:45:20,225
What is clearly not one of us.

996
01:45:27,303 --> 01:45:28,497
We'll meet again.

997
01:45:29,439 --> 01:45:32,272
I do not know where it is.

998
01:45:32,375 --> 01:45:34,366
I do not know when.

999
01:45:35,345 --> 01:45:39,475
But I know we'll meet again.
