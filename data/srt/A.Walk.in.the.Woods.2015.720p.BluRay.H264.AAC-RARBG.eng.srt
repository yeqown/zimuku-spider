00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,079
<i>Okay, stand by, everyone.</i>

3
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,830
Five, four, three, two...

4
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,397
At 52 minutes past the hour
on this Thursday morning, welcome back.

5
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,680
Joining me now is author Bill Bryson.

6
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,277
So, travel writing.

7
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,800
I'm sorry, is that a question?

8
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,279
Noel Coward once said,
"Why do the wrong people travel,"

9
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,158
"and the right people stay at home?"

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,391
Now, tell us about this
Collector's Edition Box Set.

11
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,958
"An elegant reissue of old favorites."

12
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,870
Riveting stuff.

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,798
Now, in your books, you've written
about Europe, Australia, the British Isles.

14
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,474
You actually lived there briefly.

15
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,320
Briefly. 10 years.

16
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,830
Mmm, but never America.

17
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,357
You've never written
about your home country.

18
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,990
- No, that's not exactly right...
- Why? Why nothing more personal?

19
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,795
I see. So you've moved back,
or is that just temporary?

20
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,355
No. Yes. My family,
we moved back. To New Hampshire.

21
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,430
Twenty years ago. And...
And we're still here.

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,758
"Still"? Interesting choice of words.

23
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,110
Uh, what else are you working on?
Are you writing something new?

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,270
No.

25
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,272
Not thinking of retiring on us, are you?

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,954
No, writers don't retire.

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,033
We either drink ourselves to death
or blow our brains out.

28
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,955
And which will it be for you?

29
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,153
After this interview, maybe both.

30
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,872
- Bill Bryson, pleasure to have you with us.
- Ah. Thank you.

31
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,274
Oh!

32
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,673
- Oh. Hello, stranger.
- Hello, yourself.

33
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,435
How'd it go?

34
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,910
- You saw?
- Mmm-hmm.

35
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,834
- That good, huh?
- Hey, Gramps.

36
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,032
- Hi.
- I saw, too.

37
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,272
- Oh, yeah? How'd I look?
- Do you want my honest answer?

38
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,390
Never mind.

39
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,117
- Gramps, I made it to level six.
- Level six? Way to go.

40
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,839
Did you get my message
about Earl McGregor?

41
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,754
Services are on Saturday morning.

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,996
Can't we just send flowers?

43
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,996
We could.

44
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,680
You two, hands washed,
dinner's nearly ready. Let's go.

45
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,715
Makes you think about slowing down,
doesn't it?

46
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,796
I'm so, so sorry. My condolences.

47
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,275
Deborah, we're so sorry.

48
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,910
Thank you so much for being here.
It really means a lot to me.

49
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,030
It's our pleasure.

50
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,231
Uh, I mean, not our...
Pardon me.

51
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,677
Uh, I mean, it's, uh, not a pleasant time,

52
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,673
- and it's not a time...
- No, we're just very sorry.

53
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,753
- We're very sorry.
- We're very sorry.

54
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,470
- I'll get my jacket.
- We just got here.

55
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,359
What? We've already paid our respects.
I mean, what else are we supposed to do?

56
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,671
Talk to people. It's good for you.

57
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,718
I don't like talking to people.

58
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,670
Go on.

59
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,751
How are you? How good to see you.

60
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,040
I'm gonna go for a walk.

61
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,556
Okay.

62
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,515
What on earth?

63
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,558
- You want to hike it?
- Yes.

64
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,470
Two thousand miles.

65
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,876
2118, actually.

66
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,517
No. You can't.

67
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,715
Why not?

68
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,510
Seriously, Bill.
Even for you this is ridiculous.

69
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,912
Why?
Because you think I'm too old?

70
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,834
No, it's not because I think you're too
old, it's because you are too old.

71
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,632
Oh, God, is this because of the funeral?

72
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,440
- No.
- What then?

73
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,476
Listen, I can't explain it.

74
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,230
Have a go.

75
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,317
It's just something I feel I have to do.

76
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,199
I want to explore nature.
I want to get back to my roots.

77
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,313
- Roots?
- Yeah. You know, push myself.

78
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,233
I mean, really, really hike.

79
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,515
Hike? You haven't hiked in 30 years.

80
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,196
- Exactly.
- Can't you just do this in the Volvo?

81
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,510
Catherine.

82
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,280
What if I say you can't go?

83
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,752
Well, if you felt that way
then we would discuss it.

84
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,794
You mean I'll yammer on
and you'll nod away,

85
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,600
and then you'll go ahead and do whatever
you were going to do anyway

86
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,353
without having heard a word I've said.

87
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,398
What?

88
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,914
Am I just supposed to stand here

89
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,959
and accept these obvious signs
that you have gone mad?

90
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,230
It's my old pup tent. What do you think?

91
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,680
Well, I think it's the perfect place
for you to spend the night.

92
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,512
You realize we all think
this is a terrible idea, right?

93
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,114
It's certainly been brought
to my attention.

94
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,271
- But you're still going to do it?
- Yes.

95
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,229
It's just kinda insane, Dad.
The whole thing, at your age?

96
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,195
Fit people in their 20's can't do it, Dad.

97
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,431
It takes five months and
five millions steps.

98
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,790
- Of walking.
- Yes.

99
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,360
I've been doing it for a while, you know.

100
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,479
Dad, hiking is not walking.

101
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,519
Two thousand people a year try to do this.
Less than 10% make it.

102
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,158
You ought to see the statistics
on how many people finish writing a book.

103
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,795
There's somebody
I want you to meet. All right?

104
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,235
Hey, Dave.

105
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,996
How's it going?

106
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,156
This is Dave.

107
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,396
- Dave.
- Hello.

108
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,199
He has hiked everywhere.

109
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,511
He can answer any question
you have about anything.

110
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,114
Okay. Can he tell me
why the caged bird sings?

111
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,753
Can you give us just a second? And can I?

112
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,635
Can we keep a lid on the jokes, please?

113
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,151
Pay attention while he's talking,

114
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,873
and don't say,
"You've got to be shitting me"

115
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,110
when he tells you the price of something.

116
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,034
Sam, you act like I've never camped before.

117
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,475
A tent is a tent.

118
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,677
This also has a 70 denier,
high-density, abrasion-resistant fly

119
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,319
with that same rip stop weave.

120
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,394
And just look at these seams.

121
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,518
All lap-felled.
No bias taping on the whole tent.

122
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,794
And the poles. Color-coded, DAC aluminum.

123
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,432
It's the finest craftsmanship.

124
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,637
Yeah, I've carried this one
on several sections of the trail myself.

125
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,271
For your purposes,
cannot go wrong with this monster.

126
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,829
All right, how much is it?

127
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,355
This one here is 289.

128
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,272
You've got to be shitting... Oh, okay.

129
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,031
I see what you're thinking, but out
on the trail, you're gonna thank me.

130
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,435
Are you coming?

131
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,953
You'll need a rain cover too, of course.

132
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,714
- A rain cover? Why?
- To keep out the rain.

133
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,998
- The backpacks aren't waterproof?
- Not 100%.

134
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,278
The rain cover weighs
four point six ounces.

135
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,671
You know how much weight it would add
to fully waterproof an 85-liter pack?

136
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,631
Well, I'll tell you. It's a lot.

137
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,353
Let's not forget...

138
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,518
Oh, let me guess, in case you want
to do a little impromptu gardening?

139
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,270
No. You know the saying, "Take only
memories, leave only footprints".

140
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,036
Poop.

141
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,671
- Oh, shit.
- Exactly.

142
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,755
<i>Thought you'd find these interesting.</i>

143
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,277
<i>A Virginia man's remains
left undiscovered for 18 days</i>

144
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,159
<i>after he suffers
a catastrophic medical condition</i>

145
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,675
<i>just one week into his solo trek.</i>

146
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,634
<i>Most commonly spread through
infected rodent saliva, urine, and feces,</i>

147
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,433
<i>which become airborne particles...</i>

148
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,595
<i>Several law enforcement personnel
have expressed concern</i>

149
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,320
<i>about the gruesome nature
of these latest murders,</i>

150
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,399
<i>including dismemberment
and ritualistic savagery.</i>

151
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,550
<i>You are not doing this alone.</i>

152
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,916
<i>This is Bryson.</i>

153
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,151
How would you like to join me
for a little stroll?

154
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,076
It's a chance to grab some fresh air,
while there's still some left.

155
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,878
You know, studies show
Americans need to walk more.

156
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,238
Our forefathers, they walked everywhere.

157
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,757
It'll give you something to do
for the next six months.

158
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,638
Let me know if you're interested.

159
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,356
<i>Rabies, crazed skunks,
raccoons, and squirrels,</i>

160
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,557
<i>merciless fire ants, and ravening blackfly.</i>

161
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,672
<i>Poison ivy, poison sumac, poison oak,</i>

162
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,399
<i>poison salamanders,
even a scattering of moose?</i>

163
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,876
<i>Not in this lifetime.</i>

164
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,800
<i>I wish I could, Bill,
but I just switched to a new beta blocker.</i>

165
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,870
<i>I barely have enough energy</i>

166
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,996
<i>to get dressed in the...</i>

167
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,958
<i>Next time, call me for something fun.</i>

168
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,474
<i>Like a colonoscopy.</i>

169
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,997
<i>Bill, I think you've been the victim
of identity theft.</i>

170
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,480
<i>I got the most ridiculous message</i>

171
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,789
<i>from someone claiming...</i>

172
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,952
<i>Bill, you know you can see the whole
trail online in less than four minutes?</i>

173
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,679
You know, you can't count Dan Budge.
Dying is not the same as saying no.

174
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,556
Did we know about that?
About Dan's death?

175
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,434
Yeah, I think
it was in Janice's Christmas card.

176
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,398
Well, that explains why she was so miffed
about my invitation.

177
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,156
It's in the...

178
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,312
Hello?

179
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,796
Hello?

180
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,479
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

181
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,830
I'm sorry?

182
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,472
<i>Bryson, it's Katz.</i>

183
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,152
<i>- It's Katz?
- Yeah.</i>

184
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,238
<i>- Stephen?
- Yeah.</i>

185
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,034
Whoa.

186
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,520
<i>You're in the States?</i>

187
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,953
Yeah, yeah. Where are you?

188
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,876
<i>I'm in Des Moines.
Where the hell else would I be?</i>

189
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,672
Well, it's good to hear your voice.

190
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,273
<i>Yeah. Hey, Doug told me about
this Appalachian Trail deal of yours.</i>

191
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,840
<i>Are you serious about that?</i>

192
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,158
Yes, I'm very serious.

193
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,710
<i>You think maybe I could come with you?</i>

194
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,280
You wanna come with me?

195
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,833
<i>Yeah, if it's a problem, I understand.</i>

196
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,836
<i>- No, no, no, no.
- I mean, I understand if you don't want me.</i>

197
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,232
No, why... Why wouldn't I want you?

198
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,510
<i>Because, you know,
I still owe you 600 bucks from Europe.</i>

199
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,390
Well, that was forty years ago, Stephen.

200
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,559
<i>Yeah, but I still intend to pay you.</i>

201
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,554
Well, I know you're good for it.

202
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,160
<i>Ah, great, great.</i>

203
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,398
So, what kind of shape you in?

204
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,230
<i>Well, I'm in good shape.
I walk everywhere these days.</i>

205
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,470
Really?

206
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,155
<i>Yeah, since the bastards
took away my license.</i>

207
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,669
Um...

208
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,953
So, how are you with bears?

209
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,871
<i>Well, they haven't gotten me yet.</i>

210
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,513
Well, you know there can't be a black bear
within 1,500 miles of Des Moines, Katz.

211
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,833
<i>That's what I'm saying, man.
Those fuckers keep their distance.</i>

212
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,033
You'll never guess who just gave me a call.

213
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,476
No, no, no. Not Stephen Katz.

214
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,515
Mmm-mmm.

215
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,512
You said I couldn't go alone.

216
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,912
Well, presuming you were going
to get somebody responsible.

217
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,510
You don't even know him.

218
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,956
Well, I know the stories.
Didn't he have a drinking problem?

219
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,116
We all had drinking problems.

220
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,032
Well, you two ended up
on each other's nerves in Europe.

221
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,794
No, no, no, no.
We started out on each other's nerves.

222
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,960
We ended up despising each other.

223
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,552
You know I hate this, right?

224
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,594
Sweetheart, I really don't think
you have anything to worry about.

225
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,235
No. Just my husband wandering off
into the woods,

226
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,516
surely to be maimed or killed

227
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,832
or contract some ghastly
parasitic disease which,

228
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,317
if lucky, will leave him propped up
in a chair, drooling into his own bib.

229
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,119
But there's nothing to worry about,
because of course

230
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,352
I'll be the one expected to stand
by your side, feeding you ice chips

231
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,639
until you capitulate to this
unnamed malady, and then what?

232
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,395
I get to stand in front
of some gaudy church saying,

233
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,876
"He was a loving husband and father,"

234
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,075
"once considered to be
a man of reasonable intelligence,"

235
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,879
"since revealed to be nothing more"

236
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,637
"than a daft and utter fool."

237
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,552
Well, it's a shame I won't
be there to hear it.

238
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,351
Look, I know what this seems like, okay?

239
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,472
Have you actually
thought this through at all?

240
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,715
Of course not.

241
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,876
<i>Lebanon Airport welcomes
Cape Air Flight 106.</i>

242
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,912
<i>Travelers arriving from Springfield</i>

243
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,834
<i>can claim their baggage

244
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,194
You are shitting me.

245
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,913
- Hey, Stephen.
- Bryson.

246
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,720
How are you?

247
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,309
Hello, Steve-o.

248
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,550
This is my wife.

249
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,393
You're the British nurse
I've heard so much about.

250
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,280
- I certainly hope so.
- Yeah.

251
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,750
Good to meet you.

252
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,232
That's a little bit like a bear hug.

253
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,750
Are you limping?

254
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,919
Oh, that's a titanium knee,
and this one's a trick knee, you know.

255
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,909
- Oh.
- Let me see, I've got to get...

256
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,876
I gotta eat every hour or so,
otherwise I get these, uh...

257
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,796
- What, episodes?
- No, no, they're...

258
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,838
- Seizures?
- Seizures, that's right.

259
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,270
- You get seizures?
- Mmm-hmm.

260
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,038
Yeah. You know, I ate some contaminated
phenethylamines about 10 years ago,

261
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,636
and it totally jacked up my system,
you know.

262
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,840
- I thought you said you were in shape?
- I am.

263
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,474
So the two of them take off
on a motorbike

264
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,631
and we have no choice but to hitchhike
all the way back to San Sebastian.

265
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,152
We go into the first pub, and boom,
there they are.

266
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,120
So, six hours later
we stumble out to the beach,

267
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,238
and Bryson insists on
having the pretty girl,

268
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,470
- of course, the redhead.
- Ooh.

269
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,277
And I get the horse-faced blonde, you know.

270
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,116
Uh, Bryson!

271
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,196
I can't believe... Come on, sit.

272
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,877
I can't believe
you never told Cathy about Spain.

273
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,316
Oh, it must have slipped my mind.

274
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,313
Hmm, I wonder why?

275
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,194
Anyway, the next day
we're on a train to Madrid.

276
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,155
Bryson goes to the head
and I don't pay any attention to it,

277
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,993
and he's in there a long time.

278
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,591
Finally, I look up,
and he's coming out toward the seat

279
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,478
and he's just scratching and scratching...

280
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,360
Got it. Got it.

281
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,595
I said to him,
"Hey, Bryson, what's going on?"

282
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,673
And he says,
"Next time you can have the red-head".

283
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,197
- Is there a picture of the red-head?
- I think so.

284
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,112
I'd like to see the redhead.
I'd love to see the red-head.

285
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,078
- That's a really great story.
- She's not in here.

286
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,356
- Thank you for sharing that
with my family. Where is she?

287
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,920
Well, I have more of them, Bryson.

288
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,270
No, no, that's great.

289
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,960
- No, no, I think we should have a few more.
- All right.

290
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,955
We were in Nice, and Bryson goes to this

291
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,033
very famous hotel there
called The Mayflower...

292
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,677
Mmm, the Cubbies.

293
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,557
Oh, decomposed.

294
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,400
Oh, my God.

295
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,116
You still playing that thing?

296
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,517
Oh, yeah. Not good, but I'm playing.

297
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,918
How about you, still playing the drums?

298
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,679
Oh, God, no. I gave that up years ago.

299
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,395
Oh.

300
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,155
Is that your daughter?

301
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,158
- Yeah.
- Takes after her mother. Lucky break there.

302
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,639
- How many grandchildren in all?
- Three, and another one on the way.

303
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,236
You really pulled it off, Bryson.

304
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,630
You know?

305
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,357
No, I mean that. I'm happy for you.

306
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,954
Well, how about you, Stephen?
You... You been okay?

307
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,117
Me? Oh, hell, yeah.

308
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,640
I spent half my life getting drunk,
chasing pussy.

309
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,360
The other half I wasted.

310
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,513
- Have you seen these things?
- Yeah.

311
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,030
Fucked.

312
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,630
Hey, you know,

313
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,157
everyone thinks
we're going to go onto that trail

314
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,755
and quit after a week, like most people do.

315
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,237
We're not most people, Bryson.

316
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,957
No. No, we're not.

317
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,232
- So, good night.
- Good night.

318
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,356
All right then.

319
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,075
- Thank you, Mrs. Bryson. Bye.
- You're welcome. Good luck.

320
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,031
I'll meet you inside. Right?

321
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,911
- I will miss you, you know.
- I hope so.

322
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,754
I just want to go on
the record one last time

323
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,559
and say, I do love you.

324
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,633
Try not to die, okay?

325
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,270
I'll do my best.

326
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,319
Go on. Bugger off.

327
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,199
I remember this one guy that I picked up.
He came off the Trail.

328
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,198
He's not like you guys, a lot younger.

329
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,671
He got back there and just started crying.

330
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,596
I'm serious.
Cried all the way back to Atlanta.

331
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,437
Sat back there whimpering like a child.

332
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,235
When you drop people off,

333
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,596
can you tell whether
they're going to make it or not?

334
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,153
Oh. Yes, sir, yes, sir.
Every time, pretty near.

335
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,549
How about us?

336
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,679
Oh, well, here we are.

337
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,995
Thank you.

338
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,510
- Here you go.
- Okay.

339
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,435
- Breakfast at seven.
- Seven.

340
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,040
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay.

341
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,631
I hope you don't mind my saying,

342
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,635
but these are about
the best damn pancakes I ever had.

343
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,874
Is that right? Well, I like a man
who appreciates his pancakes.

344
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,237
Well, I sure do appreciate these, honey.

345
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,078
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yeah.

346
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,594
And I'll get you a menu.

347
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,560
No, no, I've already eaten. Thanks.

348
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,235
Not bad looking, huh?

349
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,595
That depends.

350
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,074
You know what I look for
in a female these days?

351
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,112
A heartbeat and a full set of limbs.

352
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,037
Well, most people lower their standards
as they age.

353
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,197
- Yeah?
- You've actually raised yours.

354
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,519
You know, Bryson, I've been thinking.

355
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,479
Let's stay here another night.

356
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,916
- You kidding?
- No. No. It is cold outside.

357
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,390
It's warm in here.

358
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,555
- I am going.
- Wait a minute.

359
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,557
We go. We go.

360
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,114
Hey, hang on. I'd like to say a few words
if you don't mind.

361
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,790
All right.

362
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,634
- I don't want to reach for metaphors, but...
- No, reach, Bryson, reach.

363
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,837
Well, they say
the Appalachian Trail is like life.

364
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,036
Uh-huh.

365
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,555
You don't know what's ahead, you don't
know what's going to happen next,

366
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,120
but you give it your best shot.

367
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,396
Your best...

368
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,600
So, on that note...

369
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,959
- We go?
- We go.

370
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,510
All right.

371
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,755
You keeping up?

372
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,319
Yeah. Keeping up.

373
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,553
Are we hiking or strolling?

374
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,434
What, is this a race?

375
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,993
We're trying to do 11 miles.

376
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,075
Slow and steady, pal.
You wanna burn out your legs, go ahead.

377
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,199
- Just be nice to get there before midnight.
- Yeah, well.

378
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,954
That would be nice.

379
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,232
Go ahead. Help yourselves.

380
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,029
Oh, jeez.

381
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,194
Okay, complete the following sentence.

382
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,873
What goes up must come

383
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,955
down.

384
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,757
What the hell happened to down?
It can't be uphill all the way to Maine.

385
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,520
Coming through.

386
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,670
Oh, my God. All right.

387
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,399
- What's up?
- Not much.

388
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,478
- Beautiful day.
- Yeah, it sure is.

389
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,880
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

390
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,155
Little fuckers.

391
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,315
It's just over the hill, guys.

392
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,676
- Boy.
- You okay?

393
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,592
Yeah. I almost fell off the log.

394
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,078
How far do you figure we've gone?

395
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,233
Oh, about a quarter of a mile.

396
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,153
Motherfuck.

397
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,397
We're going already?

398
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,880
Just kill me now.

399
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,159
I don't care how you do it,
but please, just kill me now.

400
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,310
What, that's it? No dinner?

401
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,150
Hiya.

402
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,874
- You remember the Randall Farm?
- Of course.

403
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,239
Super-Walmart now.

404
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,670
Christ.

405
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,072
The old drive-in theater?

406
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,477
Don't tell me.

407
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,520
- Subaru dealership now.
- No.

408
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,031
Yeah. I got my first blowjob there.

409
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,033
In the Subaru dealership?

410
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,197
Bit of a late bloomer, huh?

411
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,196
I bumped into Jimmy Duncan
a few weeks back.

412
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,880
You remember him?

413
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,680
Yeah. His mom worked at the library?

414
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,992
'Course you remember his mom.

415
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,440
Yeah, she was nice.

416
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,033
And she didn't own a bra.

417
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,313
Well, if she did, she never wore it.

418
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,674
Man, I loved that library.

419
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,755
- Hey, Bryson?
- Yeah?

420
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,350
Have you really kept in touch
with Doug Glawinski all these years?

421
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,518
No, not at all. Why?

422
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,319
You invited him,
so I was just curious.

423
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,677
Well, yeah.
I invited everyone I could think of.

424
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,752
No, not everyone.

425
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,080
I heard about it from Doug.

426
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,398
I don't think I had your number.

427
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,154
You had Doug's number?

428
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,240
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I really don't like Doug.

429
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,910
Well, I don't blame you.

430
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,953
I'm not sure how that's supposed
to make me feel better, though.

431
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,116
Yeah.

432
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,910
I guess I really didn't think that through.

433
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,270
Good night.

434
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,710
Good night.

435
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,600
You burying your shit?

436
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,076
Yes.

437
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,551
- In the woods?
- Yeah.

438
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,634
Oh, Bryson, I've missed you.

439
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,356
Thank you.

440
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,516
Can't wait to read about this in the book.

441
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,990
I'm not writing a book.

442
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,795
Hi.

443
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,880
You guys camping here?

444
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,716
No, we live here.

445
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,080
What are you guys eating?

446
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,711
Noodles? Ugh, big mistake.

447
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,511
Noodles have got, like, no energy in them.
I mean, like, zero.

448
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,238
I'm Mary Ellen. Is that your tent?

449
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,596
Yeah.

450
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,279
Oh, big mistake.

451
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,394
They must have seen you coming
at the camping store.

452
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,915
- How much did you pay for it?
- I don't remember.

453
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,959
Too much. That's how much.

454
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,596
Shoulda got a three-season tent, my friend.

455
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,554
It is a three-season tent.

456
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,550
Pardon me for saying so,
but it is, like, seriously dumb

457
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,912
to come out here in March
without a three-season tent.

458
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,073
It's April.
And it is a three-season tent.

459
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,913
That's a three-season tent.

460
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,073
No, no. Those are both three-season tents.

461
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,356
No. I don't think so.

462
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,037
How many miles did you guys do today?

463
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,790
Around 10.

464
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,432
Ten? Oh, you must be really out of shape.

465
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,039
I did fourteen-two. Started at Gooch Gap.

466
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,319
Well, so did we. And it's eight point four.

467
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,115
- No.
- It is. It's eight point four.

468
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,790
Excuse me. But I think I ought to know.
I just walked it.

469
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,119
So did we. And it's eight point four.

470
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,715
Tomato, tomahto.

471
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,280
You know what your problem is?

472
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,356
You're too fat.

473
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,470
Excuse me?

474
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,400
You should have dropped some of that
tonnage before you hit the trailhead.

475
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,951
I mean, you're liable to have some sort
of serious heart thing out here.

476
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,873
And so I just walk alone,
because everybody I know is boring.

477
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,357
I'm the only person I know
who doesn't bore myself to death.

478
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,433
Also, if I walked with someone else,

479
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,230
I'd have to watch them make, you know,
mistake after mistake after mistake,

480
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,792
and I'd go crazy, and then I'd not be sane
on the trail, you know?

481
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,554
I was like, "Mary Ellen,
who's the only person you know"

482
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,637
"who doesn't mess up?" and it's like, me.

483
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,671
I went through this person,
it was, like, dumb.

484
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,197
That person, boring. This person, dumb.
Dumb, dumb. Boring, boring.

485
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,591
I know what you're thinking.
I'm not married.

486
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,910
I wonder why?

487
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,995
Well, I do have a boyfriend,
but he's in Florida and he's in prison.

488
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,397
I wouldn't hike with him even if he wasn't

489
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,712
because you can't trust a convict,
and he's dumb.

490
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,759
And boring, actually.

491
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,558
What's your star sign?
I bet you're a Gemini, aren't you?

492
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,831
Ah, I'm really good at this. I have a gift.

493
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,350
- No, I'm not a Gemini.
- I think you are.

494
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,520
Actually, I'm a Leo.

495
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,871
I don't think so. I'm really good at this.

496
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,280
I was born in August.

497
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,192
Mmm, check your birth certificate.

498
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,836
And you? You're a Libra.

499
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,714
Definitely a Libra.
I could make a living doing this.

500
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,880
You're zero for two, honey. Zero for two.

501
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,554
Can you guys guess what I am?

502
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,717
- Couple of thoughts come to mind.
- Yeah?

503
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,392
<i>She's up all night to the sun.</i>

504
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,551
<i>I'm up all night to get some.</i>

505
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,632
<i>She's up all night for good fun.</i>

506
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,234
<i>We're up all night to get lucky.</i>

507
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,070
Fuck.

508
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,837
God damn it. Damn it!

509
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,474
I swear to God I'm gonna
rip her larynx out.

510
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,839
I'm not sure that's going to do it.
I got a better plan.

511
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,229
Go on, lay it on me.

512
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,552
Okay, according to the map,
we get to Hiawassee tomorrow.

513
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,430
We get an early start and we hike hard,
we can put some distance between us.

514
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,719
Yeah, that's probably better than my plan.

515
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,076
What's your plan?

516
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,112
Kill her. Take her Pop-tarts.

517
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,712
- Hey, good morning.
- Good morning.

518
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,590
You guys heading out?

519
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,278
Yeah. You want us to wait for you?

520
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,430
Yeah, we'll wait.

521
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,429
Nah, I'll catch up. I'm pretty regular.

522
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,876
We go.

523
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,674
We've still got a couple more miles.

524
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,030
How far back is she?

525
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,515
She's gaining.

526
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,239
- I don't think...
- I don't...

527
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,230
We need a new plan.

528
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,637
- Yeah, we do. We need a new plan.
- Yeah.

529
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,556
Shh.

530
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,154
I didn't say anything.

531
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,040
- Well, you sound like a DC-10. Keep it down.
- Oh.

532
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,190
Here she comes.

533
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,520
Hold your breath.

534
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,836
Hold it, hold it.

535
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,879
<i>We've come too far to give up
who we are.</i>

536
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,470
We go, we go!

537
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,439
- Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- Hey!

538
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,552
Wait, stop!

539
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,515
Who the hell's gonna stop for us?
We look like shit.

540
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,238
Hey, stop!

541
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,750
They stopped!

542
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,194
Hey, you boys want a ride?

543
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,870
Sure do!

544
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,756
Y'all have to excuse us.
We are celebrating.

545
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,032
Yeah? What are you celebrating?

546
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,392
We are getting married tomorrow.

547
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,475
- Great, great.
- Congratulations, you guys.

548
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,918
Yeah, Darren is making
an honest woman out of me.

549
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,354
- Ain't that right, baby?
- Yes, I am.

550
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,514
Uh, you wanna watch the...

551
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,750
Yeah.

552
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,314
Holy shit. I wish I was still 20.

553
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,719
I wish I was still 50.

554
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,799
See y'all later.
Bye, y'all.

555
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,435
What can I get you boys to drink?

556
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,911
The tallest and the coldest beer
you can offer.

557
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,070
Coke.

558
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,592
- Just Coke, nothing in it?
- Just Coke. I'm reformed.

559
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,672
- Okay.
- Uh, you know what?

560
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,512
Make mine a Coke also.

561
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,639
All right. Just a second.

562
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,632
Oh, wow. I'm... I'm impressed.

563
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,473
Well, you know, ever since
I rolled my car on route six,

564
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,594
- I had to rethink some things.
- Yeah, that'll do it.

565
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,511
A lady cop came up to the window
and she knocked.

566
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,592
I was hanging upside down by the seatbelt
and I said, "What's the problem, officer?"

567
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,190
She just stared at me and walked away.

568
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,233
So I haven't had a drink since.

569
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,596
- Really?
- Yeah.

570
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,195
Well, that's good.

571
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,674
- Good for you.
- Yeah. Good for me.

572
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,356
Really.

573
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,636
Ah.

574
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,590
You know, Bryson,

575
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:24,715
I keep looking at the door over there and
I keep seeing Mary Ellen coming through.

576
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,274
I hope you're not going to tell me
you miss her?

577
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,479
Oh, no, no. Hell no,
I'm not going to tell you that.

578
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,354
I mean, we did kind of ditch her though,
didn't we?

579
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,035
No, we didn't just kind of ditch her,
Stephen. We ditched her.

580
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:41,080
Yeah. We left her all alone in the woods
by herself.

581
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,435
She came into the woods by herself.

582
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,200
It's not like we signed a contract
to look after her.

583
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,000
No, but she's probably scared out
of her wits.

584
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,199
What are you so interested in her for?

585
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,789
I'm not interested in her at all.

586
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,911
The damndest thing,
Bryson, is I am a Libra.

587
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,955
She got it right.

588
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,712
Maybe she has a gift.

589
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,000
What are the chances?

590
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,359
One in 12, actually.

591
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,117
One in 12. That's pretty damn good.

592
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,632
Oh. Southbound, coming through.

593
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,995
<i>Mary Ellen?
Oh, yeah, she talked about you guys.</i>

594
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,349
Yeah? What did she say?

595
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,440
- Well, her words, right?
- Right.

596
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,791
She said you guys
were a couple of overweight wimps

597
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,434
who didn't know the
first thing about hiking.

598
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,755
And she was tired of carrying you.

599
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,153
Oh, Holy Christ Almighty.

600
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,556
Actually, I think she called you
a couple of pussies.

601
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,194
- Pussies?
- Pussies?

602
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,635
After all we did for her?

603
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,079
You guys know it's supposed to snow
tonight, right? Six to eight inches.

604
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,993
- Really?
- More higher up.

605
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,119
That's what they're saying.
You're going to be climbing right into it.

606
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,470
- Yeah? Oh.
- Yeah.

607
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,237
- Well, I gotta keep moving, guys. Be safe.
- Thanks.

608
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,115
Snow?
That guy's out of his fucking mind.

609
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,396
You okay?

610
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,240
Never better.

611
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,994
Goddamn things are useless.

612
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,440
What I'm thinking
we could do is follow this logging road,

613
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,271
get to the other side of this ridge,
and get out of the wind

614
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,920
where we can set up our camp.
What do you think?

615
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,194
Me? I think I'd rather have a nice hot soak
in a Jacuzzi.

616
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,555
But if you're dead-set on following
that logging road, we can do that, too.

617
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:56,193
We can save the Jacuzzi for another time
when things aren't going so well.

618
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,476
Yeah.

619
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,153
- I'll follow you.
- Okay.

620
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,354
Katz, you still there?

621
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,870
Unfortunately.

622
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,353
Just like you said, Bryson.

623
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:35,359
The AT. You never know what lies ahead.

624
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,915
So it appears.

625
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,837
I promise you, if there was heat,
it would be on, honey, all right?

626
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,157
Use the talcum powder, that helps.

627
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:10,399
Hi. We'd like a cabin.
Preferably with a private bath.

628
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,710
The cabins went two days ago.
But I do have two spaces in the bunkhouse.

629
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,316
I don't know
if you're aware of this, Bryson,

630
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,474
but every time I hear the word "bunkhouse"

631
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,199
my testicles shrink up inside my body.

632
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,150
Welcome to the Stalag.

633
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,590
There's a meeting of the Escape Committee
at 1900 hours.

634
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,830
Oh, okay.

635
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,120
Hey, are you liking that XT-85?

636
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,395
Your pack.

637
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,676
Oh.

638
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,112
- I got a Gregory.
- Oh, yeah?

639
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,755
Yeah. I looked at the XT-85, solid pack.

640
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,030
But the quad access points,

641
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,391
dual hydration ports in the Gregory,
they sold me.

642
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,839
What made you buy an XT-85?

643
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,196
I thought it was easier
than carrying everything in my arms.

644
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,317
- How come you're up top?
- Well, heat rises, pal.

645
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,040
Oh, yeah.

646
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,040
Hey, you know...

647
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,634
Hey, Bryson, are you all right?

648
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,400
Oh, never better.

649
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,794
We can start, maybe, right there and...

650
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,920
Hello, there.

651
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,878
You guys, uh, doing all right?

652
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,955
Yeah, we're fine.

653
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,760
Because, look,
when we get over to the other side,

654
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,957
we can just come back
and grab your packs if you want?

655
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,470
You know, it's easy for us.

656
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,915
- Not a problem.
- Happy to help.

657
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,916
We like hard, we don't like easy.
But thanks a lot, you know.

658
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,392
- All right, then.
- Okay.

659
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,998
- Excuse us. All right.
- Yep.

660
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,313
- Nice guys.
- Yep.

661
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,752
- I hate 'em.
- Me, too.

662
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,430
Well...

663
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,680
- That went well.
- It was refreshing.

664
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,356
Bryson, you've got everything
a man could want.

665
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,511
And here you are,
tramping around in the woods with me.

666
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,875
Seriously, what gives?

667
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,833
I don't know.

668
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,600
As John Muir once said,
"Sometimes a man just has to"

669
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,350
"get a loaf of bread and throw it into a
sack, and jump over the back fence."

670
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,552
Oh, I got you.

671
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,400
Life's a little too perfect
inside that fence, huh?

672
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,270
- No, no, no...
- Oh, you made sense, Bryson.

673
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,959
You're a caged animal.

674
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,312
You wanna get back into that forest.
Live a little.

675
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,320
- That's not it.
- No, that's got to be it.

676
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,834
So why'd you come?

677
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,076
I guess I didn't want to spend
the rest of my life in jail.

678
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,877
- What?
- It's nothing, really.

679
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,198
Just a couple of outstanding warrants
I didn't show up for and stuff like that.

680
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,916
Jesus, Stephen, that's really not something
you can run from.

681
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,837
Actually, you kind of can.

682
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,877
Same old Stephen.
Always running from something.

683
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,675
Oh, really? You're one to talk.

684
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,475
Not you.

685
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,872
Remind me again why we're out here?

686
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,355
It's was not like you had something better
to do.

687
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,955
As I recall, in fact,
you begged me to come.

688
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,954
I begged? I begged to come? I asked.

689
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,037
You know what cracks me up, Bryson?

690
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:56,476
Is how predictable your whole life
has become, right down to the Volvo.

691
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,392
God forbid somebody should evolve

692
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,273
rather than squandering away
their existence.

693
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,757
I mean, look at you. All these years
and you're still stuck at square one.

694
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,232
Hey, Bryson. Are you happy?

695
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,993
What the hell kind of a question is that?

696
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,311
Pretty important question, I'd say.

697
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,635
What, do you think you're happy?

698
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,355
I think...

699
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,360
Wow.

700
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,320
The Smokies.

701
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,432
Now this is interesting.

702
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,759
Oh, God, this is amazing.

703
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,196
From here you can see
all three kinds of rock.

704
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,151
There, you see that layered section
across that slant?

705
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,794
- Yeah.
- That's sedimentary.

706
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,431
And the dark stuff here, pushing up
from underneath, that's igneous.

707
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,670
Think volcanic.

708
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,191
How do you know all this stuff?

709
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,033
Well, there are these things called books.

710
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,270
- Oh. No kidding, they're called books?
- Yeah, they're like TV for smart people.

711
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,715
See, what we're talking about here,
Katz, is time.

712
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,636
Geologic time.

713
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:14,592
Hundreds of thousands of years
of enormous, shifting tectonic plates.

714
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,913
It's like the world being reborn from below
while it's being eroded from above.

715
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,960
Yeah. Well,

716
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,676
when we get back I'm gonna buy you a TV.

717
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:29,040
Because nobody gives a fuck
about shifting tectonic plates.

718
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,230
Well, I do.

719
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,029
You know why?

720
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,075
Because I'm curious,
and I love being curious.

721
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,916
I like knowing things about the world
that we're living in.

722
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,631
Well, I think it's all fucking rock.

723
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,360
Oh, yeah?

724
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,676
I don't get bogged down in the minutiae.

725
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,429
- I'm above the details.
- You are?

726
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,916
I'm big picture, Bryson.

727
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,720
Oh. How's that working out for you?

728
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,235
Ah, pretty, uh, fucking good.

729
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,956
Hello.

730
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,635
We'd like a room, please.

731
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,400
Two rooms.

732
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,432
Oh, the Cubbies lost a double header,
and they're 11 games back.

733
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,995
Don't act surprised.

734
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,153
Tonight would be preferable.

735
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,640
Hello there?

736
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,432
Where are the Red Sox?

737
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,954
Red Sox? Are you fucking kidding me? Whoa.

738
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,356
Excuse me, ma'am.

739
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,432
- Red Sox?
- I live in New England.

740
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,150
Yeah, but Bryson, it's not about
where you live, it's about who you are.

741
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,279
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm the kind of guy that
likes it when a team wins now and then.

742
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,840
Well, you don't...

743
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,071
You don't give up on a team just because
they've had a few bad years.

744
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,312
A few bad years? Jesus.

745
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,637
Baseball is about loyalty.

746
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,113
Like, she knows what I'm talking about.
Don't you?

747
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,074
Would you two like a minute?

748
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,992
Hi, I'm Jeannie. How can I help y'all?

749
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,432
Mother, let go of the man's hand.

750
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,474
- Hi.
- Hi.

751
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,196
Um, we'd like a couple of rooms. Please.

752
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,597
Oh, sure. Where are you all from?

753
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,551
Uh, I live in New Hampshire,
but I spent over 10 years in England.

754
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,115
- Mostly in the north countryside...
- He's from Iowa.

755
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,034
Well, the rooms are 40 a night
and you can pay when you leave.

756
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,193
Mother, I said, "Let go of the man's hand".

757
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:52,995
Thank you.

758
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,036
Helluva grip.

759
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,795
The Cubs should sign her.
She'd be the youngest in their bullpen.

760
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,234
- I guess this is me.
- Yeah, okay. I'm right here.

761
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,240
- Yeah.
- Yeah. All right. I'll see you.

762
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,355
Yeah.

763
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,435
Ah!

764
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,593
- Hi.
- Hello, again.

765
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,950
- How can I help you?
- I just need some towels.

766
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,277
- Oh. I'm sorry about that.
- That's fine.

767
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,914
- Here, come with me.
- Okay.

768
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:34,040
Yeah, it's family owned and operated. For
three generations, if you can believe it.

769
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,676
Oh, I can.

770
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,718
It has a personal feel to it.
That's pretty rare these days.

771
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,034
Eighty-three years.

772
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,150
Wow.

773
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,472
We, um... We added the restaurant
10 years ago.

774
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,791
- So you manage that, too?
- Yeah.

775
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,160
Somebody's gotta do it.

776
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,877
It's not so bad.
I get to meet interesting people.

777
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,999
I'm not sure
I qualify as interesting.

778
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,680
Oh, I wasn't talking about you.

779
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,637
Sorry. Could not resist.

780
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,153
- I'm glad I'm here to amuse you.
- Yeah, yeah. Me, too.

781
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,355
This is you.

782
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,320
You must be exhausted.

783
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,559
Holy shit.

784
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,360
I... I gave you a couple extras.

785
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,270
Enjoy your shower.

786
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,155
I will, thanks.

787
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,600
Do you need anything else?

788
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,955
No. Not at the moment.

789
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,516
Okay.

790
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,278
Well, you know where I am. All right.

791
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,675
<i>We're not here right now,</i>

792
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,878
<i>but please leave a message
and thank you for calling. Bye.</i>

793
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,320
Hi, sweetie. It's me.
Uh, just calling to say I love you.

794
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,630
Right, right. That's the one.

795
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,475
Nice, isn't it? I like it.

796
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,677
Everything good
on the home front?

797
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,594
She's impressed
we haven't killed ourselves yet.

798
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,593
She's not the only one.

799
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,237
Did you tell her about last night?

800
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,956
What?

801
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,440
You in a robe?

802
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:46,472
The proprietress,
I'm sure, was looking to hand over

803
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,433
more than just towels.

804
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:49,956
You're out of your mind.

805
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,476
Am I?

806
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,794
Sure will make a steamy
chapter in the book.

807
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,514
Katz, I told you I'm not writing a book.

808
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,557
Listen, I'm going to go
over to, uh, K-Mart.

809
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,636
Get a couple of things. You okay?

810
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,230
Oh, I'm in my happy place.

811
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,115
Good.

812
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,037
Idiot!

813
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,159
Oh, wait, wait.

814
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,869
Here, here.

815
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,274
- Here you are, ma'am. Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

816
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,400
- Pardon me.
- Hmm?

817
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,515
I'm so sorry. Do you think
you could give me a hand here?

818
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,238
Well, certainly. I'd be happy to.

819
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,712
What seems to be the problem?

820
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,753
I'm having a difficult time
removing my panties.

821
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,394
Well, luckily you're

822
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,472
- in the presence of an expert.
- Oh.

823
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,234
May I?

824
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,078
- Oh, they're silk, aren't they?
- Mmm-hmm.

825
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,036
I'm a pantyologist.

826
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,111
Really? I've never heard of that.

827
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,954
- Oh.
- Oh.

828
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,749
Well,

829
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,436
these aren't gonna do you much good.

830
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,752
Well, they might not do me
much bad, either.

831
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,074
No.

832
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,758
- Jesus, Bryson.
- Don't ask.

833
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,799
You been screwing hogs again?

834
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,275
You're just jealous.

835
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,274
Actually, I'm not.

836
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:04,237
In your absence, my romantic life
has taken a turn for the better.

837
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,475
Remember the laundromat?

838
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,119
Her name is Beulah.

839
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:10,710
Seriously?

840
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,078
Yeah, seriously.
And she's got a beautiful body.

841
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,756
Buried under two hundred pounds of fat.

842
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,393
But then, you know I kinda like
a little meat on the bone.

843
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,269
Sure, as long as you don't have to
remove a wall to get her out of the house.

844
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,029
How did this happen?

845
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,352
She asked me if I would come
take a look at her panties.

846
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,677
- What?
- They were caught in the agitator.

847
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,276
And they were shredded.

848
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:41,230
So I'm gonna meet her this afternoon
in front of the fire station.

849
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,353
Is that where she keeps
her spare underwear?

850
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,836
I'm telling you, man,
I felt a stiffening of the old resolve.

851
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,309
- Oh, yeah?
- I got her these.

852
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,994
Oh, she's a big woman.

853
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,350
Where'd you get these?

854
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,353
K-Mart. I took a cab.

855
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,720
Um, I thought I'd give
'em to her at dinner.

856
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,315
As an ice-breaker.

857
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,638
You're gonna give those to her
in a restaurant?

858
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,790
Yeah.

859
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,872
Unless you think it's a bad idea.

860
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,554
No. I think that's a great idea.

861
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,475
Good.

862
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,269
Hey.

863
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,800
- You had the turkey, right?
- Yes.

864
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,234
- Enjoy.
- All right.

865
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,880
We go. We go.

866
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,475
- What are you talking about?
- There's some guy looking for me!

867
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,716
Some guy?

868
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:55,916
Beulah's husband.

869
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,799
- Beulah's got a husband?
- Yeah.

870
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:01,591
I mean, there's only two guys on the planet
that would go to bed with her,

871
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,156
and here we are in the same damned town!

872
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,594
So what happened?

873
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,354
I'm standing in front of the fire station
like we planned.

874
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,510
Yeah.

875
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:14,913
And then around the corner comes
this red pickup and it screeches to a halt.

876
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,239
And this big guy, he's angry, he gets out,

877
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:21,479
and he's walking up towards me,
and he's going like this.

878
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,795
"I want to talk to you."

879
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,353
- So what did you do?
- I ran.

880
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,036
You ran?

881
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,794
Yeah. I can move like a jack-rabbit
if I have to.

882
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:33,715
- So he didn't catch you?
- No, no. He's 600 pounds.

883
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,036
He's not exactly a track star.

884
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:39,670
He's cruising around now in his red
pickup truck looking for me.

885
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:44,152
I been running through back yards,
clothes lines, all sorts of shit.

886
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,190
- Well, you're safe now.
- This guy is...

887
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,115
Red pickup!

888
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,320
And there's another one!

889
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,352
Come on, Bryson, we need a plan!

890
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:59,319
Why don't you go out and talk to the guy,
huh? I'm sure he's reasonable.

891
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,310
That's your plan?

892
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,559
I don't need a plan.
I'm not being chased.

893
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,795
Now, come on, Bryson,
we gotta get outta here.

894
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,315
- Yeah.
- Come on, don't mess around with me.

895
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,995
Please?

896
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,400
- Come on!
- Yeah, yeah.

897
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,960
Hey buddy, you in there?

898
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:33,150
It's Bubba T. Flubba! Are you in there,
boy? Come out, you chicken shit!

899
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:35,471
Come on! Don't mess around!

900
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,030
Open up!

901
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,430
I know you're in there, you son of a bitch!

902
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:56,756
Holy shit.

903
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,196
He's here!

904
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,874
I don't care where the hell you are,

905
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,872
I'll knock every one
of these damned doors down!

906
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:05,199
Come on, I know you're in here somewhere,
you son of a bitch!

907
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:09,718
I don't care where you are,
I'm gonna find you!

908
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,152
I want to know who's been messing
with my Beulah!

909
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,670
- Bring your ass out here!
- Come on, Bryson!

910
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,872
Pull me through! He's at the door!

911
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,114
Open the goddamned door!

912
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,680
Come on, move it! Move it!

913
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,399
But what about Basel?
When we stole the boat?

914
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,031
We didn't steal
the boat, we borrowed the boat.

915
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:49,990
Yes, well, the girl's uncle
with the shotgun, he saw it differently.

916
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:51,750
He sure did.

917
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,516
You know,
you missed out in Greece.

918
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,199
I'd kind of had
my fill by that point.

919
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,957
When you said you were gonna go
to England, I thought you'd last,

920
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,714
one week. Tops.

921
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,119
- Well, I met a gal.
- Yeah.

922
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,190
And that was that.

923
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,120
Well... Yeah, thank you.

924
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:55,111
Cathy seems great. But obviously
you've been with other women.

925
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,396
Never?

926
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:02,674
In the last 40 years?

927
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,036
Nope.

928
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:12,551
Bullshit, you son of a bitch.

929
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:17,472
I saw you undress that proprietress
six ways to Sunday.

930
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,360
- You can't tell me you didn't.
- Well...

931
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,318
One woman all these years?

932
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,476
Yep.

933
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,399
That can't be good for you.

934
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,353
I mean, when was the last time
that you even got a, uh...

935
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,794
Well, never mind.
I know how married women are.

936
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:42,869
Really? Is that so?

937
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:47,432
Yeah. Trust me. I've been with way more
married women than you have.

938
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:16,273
Hey, Katz, you awake?

939
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,198
No.

940
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,390
What was that?

941
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,198
How the hell should I know?

942
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:27,754
It sounded big.

943
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:31,078
Everything sounds big
in the woods, Bryson.

944
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,320
It's probably just a skunk. Go to bed.

945
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,270
Did you pack a knife?

946
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:42,630
No.

947
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:43,910
Nothing sharp?

948
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,757
Nail clippers.

949
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,240
Swell.

950
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,913
Just leave it alone, Bryson.
It will go away.

951
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,233
Oh, yeah, well if it is a bear
and it comes toward you,

952
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,198
what are you going to do?
Give it a pedicure?

953
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:03,232
Jesus! Two fucking bears
staring right at me.

954
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,354
Oh, god dammit, Bryson, get some sleep.

955
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:09,430
Holy shit.

956
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,114
If they come for us, play dead.

957
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,795
If they come for us, we are dead.

958
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:18,640
No, wait, wait, wait.

959
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,520
That's grizzlies. Wait a minute.

960
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,395
Motherfuck.
They're tearing everything apart.

961
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,272
Okay. "Stand up as tall as you can
to intimidate the bear."

962
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,032
Intimidate the bear? They're fucking bears!

963
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:36,799
We've got to scare them off.

964
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,280
Get! Scat!

965
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,353
You gotta put this in the book.

966
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:14,200
- There's not going to be a goddamned book.
- Oh.

967
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,355
Jeez. Damn.

968
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,233
Come on, we're having fun.

969
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,675
Holy shit.

970
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,718
- Look at this.
- What?

971
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:07,759
This is the trail.

972
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,711
Here we are. We're not even halfway there.

973
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,917
- This can't be right.
- Son of a bitch.

974
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,594
No way that's to scale.

975
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,595
It says, "Map to Scale".

976
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,877
That's it. New plan.

977
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,674
God damn it.

978
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:33,192
I'm telling you, Bryson,
there's a lot of advantages.

979
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,717
You want to drive the Appalachian Trail?

980
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:41,714
No, no, just jump ahead.
Pick up the trail a little further north.

981
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:46,116
You know, we can rent a car over here.

982
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,397
Then we're mobile, we'll see more.

983
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,591
Check out local points of interest.

984
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,712
Bigger field of vision.

985
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,638
Bryson, as a friend,

986
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,877
do this for me.

987
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,431
Hey, you're not gonna believe the deal
I got on this.

988
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,790
Katz...

989
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,112
This beauty represents not one,
but two upgrades.

990
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:43,275
Satellite radio, leather seats, sunroof.
Same price as a Camry.

991
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:44,676
If you can believe that.

992
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,355
Here you go, Mr. Katz. Just three quick
initials and you'll be on your way.

993
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,715
We can't do this.

994
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,999
Of course we can.

995
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,679
I came out here to accomplish something.

996
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,832
Not to just give up
when things got a little tough.

997
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,951
We're not giving up, Bryson.

998
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,839
What does it matter
if we skip the shitty parts?

999
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,432
- No one's gonna know.
- Well, I will.

1000
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,838
I'm not a quitter.
I know it served you well in your life,

1001
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,316
- but I finish what I start.
- Bryson.

1002
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:13,353
- Did we not both see the same map?
- Yeah.

1003
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:17,197
You have no chance of finishing this trail.

1004
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,115
None. Zero. Zilch.

1005
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:21,680
Well, I'm sure as hell gonna try.

1006
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,357
Hike until you die.

1007
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,035
Where do I sign up?

1008
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:31,159
We're two old men, Bryson.
You gotta quit thinking otherwise.

1009
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:32,390
Speak for yourself.

1010
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:37,200
Just because you don't accept something,
Bryson, doesn't mean it's not true.

1011
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,319
- Well, that's interesting, coming from you.
- Just three initials is all...

1012
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,834
It's everything with you, Bryson.

1013
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,550
Christ, if someone asks you
where you're from, you can't even answer.

1014
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,917
Oh, so I'm the one in denial, huh?

1015
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,640
When you're the one
hiding whiskey in your pack.

1016
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:52,910
- Oh.
- I saw the bottle.

1017
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:56,393
So I guess neither of us
can accept who we really are.

1018
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,520
Oh, I know who I am and why I'm here.

1019
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,239
I came out here to be with you,

1020
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:05,233
to sneak in one last adventure
before it's too late.

1021
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,751
Well, this is my adventure,
and you signed on.

1022
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,439
You can do whatever you want,
but you're not going to drag me down.

1023
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,277
- If you could just use that pen to sign...
- Fine!

1024
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,392
- I don't want your car.
- Excuse me?

1025
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,069
I don't want your goddamn car.

1026
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,360
Fine!

1027
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,240
- Well, that's the spirit.
- Yeah. Fuck.

1028
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:35,400
I sure am glad
we aren't driving right now.

1029
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:38,077
- You?
- I couldn't be happier.

1030
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,240
You know, 50 years ago,

1031
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,792
one in every four of these trees
was an American Chestnut.

1032
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,960
- You know what that is? You ever seen one?
- I think so.

1033
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,075
It's incredible.

1034
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:56,711
They rise from the forest floor,
clear to the top. 100 feet.

1035
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:00,272
And their branches contain
an acre of leaves. An acre.

1036
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:02,834
You look into these woods

1037
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,430
and you think they've always been there
and always will be,

1038
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,393
like this old oak tree here.

1039
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,838
And then you think about
the poor unsuspecting American Chestnut,

1040
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:15,716
and think just in a lifetime... Poof. Gone.
Just like that.

1041
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,150
What happened to it?

1042
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,070
A fungus.

1043
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,311
You know. Just, you know, time. Nature.

1044
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,911
You know, Bryson,
I wasn't actually hiding this.

1045
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,910
I wasn't lying about being dry either.

1046
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,200
The thing is, Bryson, I love to drink.
Everything about it.

1047
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,078
I love the taste.

1048
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,839
And that buzz you get
after you've had a couple.

1049
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,910
I love the smell of the tavern,
right down to the urinal cakes.

1050
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:27,436
Hmm.

1051
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:31,117
But instead of going into the taverns
like everybody else,

1052
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:35,715
I go home to my little apartment,
and heat my TV dinner,

1053
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:39,079
and feel all virtuous like I'm supposed to.

1054
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:45,111
But you know, night after night
it's hard to persuade yourself

1055
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:48,950
that you're living a rich
and thrilling existence.

1056
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,120
I mean, if they had a fun-o-meter

1057
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:58,913
the needle wouldn't exactly be jumping
into the orgasmic zone.

1058
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,239
You know what I'm saying?

1059
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:09,837
I mean, there's just this hole in my life
where drinking used to be.

1060
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,512
I know I can't drink.

1061
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,077
I mean, one drink will lead to 10.

1062
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:24,349
And the next thing, I'll find myself
underneath a bridge somewhere.

1063
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:35,159
That's why I carry this.

1064
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,040
To remind myself that I can.

1065
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:44,350
Or maybe I carry it in case I can't.

1066
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:47,710
Here.

1067
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:50,350
Open it.

1068
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,794
It's sealed.

1069
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,669
Give it to me.

1070
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:10,994
It's shaking.

1071
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,153
Do you think I have it in me

1072
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:28,392
to never have another drink
for the rest of my life?

1073
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:33,555
Yeah. I do.

1074
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,514
That was a nice moment.

1075
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,272
Real dramatic.

1076
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,275
Christ if I don't already regret it.

1077
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,880
Ain't that life.

1078
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,553
Watch it.

1079
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:29,316
You know, Bryson, I still dream
about Amorina. You remember her?

1080
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,952
Oh, God, can't forget
a girl like that.

1081
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:37,392
You know guys like us aren't supposed
to meet women named Amorina.

1082
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:39,794
Disturbs the natural order.

1083
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:45,319
Still the best boobs I've ever seen,
and I've seen a lot of boobs, Bryson.

1084
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:46,556
Yeah, I'll bet.

1085
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:49,994
Hey, you remember her sister?

1086
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:53,632
Oh, God, that poor girl.
They couldn't have been sisters.

1087
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,197
If you're going to be ugly,
you better be funny.

1088
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,516
And if you're ugly and you're not funny,
you better have money.

1089
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:02,516
And if you're zero for three,
you better be slutty.

1090
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:08,360
- She was.
- Wait a minute, how did you know that, huh?

1091
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,710
Well, actually...

1092
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,520
Jesus Christ.

1093
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,831
Next time you do that, let me know, okay?

1094
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,039
It's more fun if it's a surprise.

1095
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:42,955
- You all right?
- You okay?

1096
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,156
Yeah.

1097
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,475
Jesus.

1098
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,195
Oh...

1099
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,155
We are fucked.

1100
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,400
Monumentally.

1101
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,479
There's no way out over here.

1102
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:35,549
Uh...

1103
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,116
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna get us out of here.

1104
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,199
- Give me your pants.
- Uh, no, no.

1105
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,798
You've been planning this
the whole time, Bryson.

1106
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,837
Just give me your pants, okay?

1107
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:50,590
Okay.

1108
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:08,520
Okay. Knot this thing.

1109
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:13,800
- All right?
- Okay.

1110
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:15,876
Here we go.

1111
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,559
It is embarrassing, Bryson.
Give me that thing.

1112
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,796
You gotta admit,
pretty good aim, though, huh?

1113
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:47,799
Yeah. But you're supposed to hold on
to one end of it.

1114
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:52,434
Well, you know, it's not that high.

1115
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:56,039
Here, I got it. You see this?
You could come up here.

1116
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:59,551
I'll be around like this
and you could climb up on my shoulders.

1117
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,999
- Wanna try it?
- Okay.

1118
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:07,156
Okay. Hang on.

1119
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,030
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1120
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:15,713
We can make it. Hold...

1121
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,398
- You all right? What?
- Yeah, hang on. You know...

1122
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:24,510
This isn't... You've got to get lower,
so I can get on your shoulders.

1123
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,200
Fuck. Fine.

1124
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:35,870
Okay.

1125
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,150
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1126
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:41,912
Okay. There we go.

1127
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,550
Bryson, I really don't like this.

1128
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:49,752
No, no, it's good, it's good.
Now, you stand up. Stand up.

1129
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:58,509
Jesus!

1130
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:00,710
Who are we kidding?

1131
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:04,550
For Christ's sake, I can't even
get myself up from that position.

1132
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,032
- All right, then. I'll stand on your back.
- How about I stand on your back?

1133
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:15,355
You know,

1134
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,960
I think we're really stuck here.

1135
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,072
Yeah. Yeah, we are.

1136
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,872
You know, on the East coast
hardwoods are dying.

1137
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,112
Not just the chestnut,

1138
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,871
but the elm's on its way, too, you know.

1139
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:40,355
Fifty years, this could all be gone.

1140
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:43,753
Thirty days.

1141
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,076
Hmm?

1142
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:50,279
Thirty days in jail.
I was afraid of 30 days.

1143
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,435
Compared to this,

1144
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:58,031
I mean, it's like a goddamned trip
to the spa.

1145
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:06,032
God, all I've done is write forewords
for books

1146
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,520
for the last four and a half years.

1147
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,310
I should have just retired.

1148
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:13,154
Catherine was right,
what the hell am I trying to prove?

1149
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:18,637
Women love a felony record.

1150
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:24,160
Maybe not up in New Hampshire,
where you are.

1151
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:29,035
But in Des Moines,
it would have served me well.

1152
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:31,314
Do you just get to the point where

1153
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:35,996
it's all about ailments,
and medications, and funerals,

1154
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:39,115
and who's being diagnosed with what,

1155
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,835
and everyone's just waiting around
for the end.

1156
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:45,958
- Holy shit.
- What?

1157
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:49,875
I just realized, we're
the guy in the article.

1158
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:55,359
You know, the, uh, decomposed guy.
Remember that?

1159
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:57,394
That'll be us.

1160
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:00,760
How long does it take a body
to decompose?

1161
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,393
Well, you don't have to worry.

1162
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:07,077
You're so chock-full of preservatives,
you'll be on this ledge forever.

1163
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:13,911
Well, scientists will come from
all over the world to study me, you know.

1164
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:16,880
I miss Catherine.

1165
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,158
I miss Des Moines.

1166
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:23,873
You know, I haven't missed a State Fair
in 39 years.

1167
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:29,237
I always say, "When I miss one",

1168
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:32,515
"I'll be dead."

1169
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:35,672
You know, she makes this little sound
whenever I hug her.

1170
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,513
I don't even think she knows it.

1171
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:42,432
I've never told her how much I love that.

1172
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:50,394
I just don't want her to think this trip
had anything to do with her.

1173
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,234
She knows.

1174
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:58,350
Believe me, women have a way
of knowing these things.

1175
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,118
Yeah, but still, I'd like to tell her.

1176
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,558
Well, write her a note.

1177
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:08,798
People love to get notes.

1178
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,479
- Hey, you know, you're right.
- Yeah.

1179
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,360
Hey, that's a great idea.

1180
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:31,280
You know, Bryson, you're the only guy
I'd risk my life with.

1181
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,600
I want you to know that.

1182
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:42,314
And the only asshole who can get me out
on a ledge in the middle of nowhere.

1183
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,633
I'm sorry we lost touch.

1184
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,318
I know. Yeah, me too.

1185
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:06,000
Goddamned gorgeous night.

1186
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:10,994
It sure is.

1187
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,309
You think
there's anyone else on Earth

1188
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,835
looking up at the sky and seeing
as many stars as we are?

1189
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:21,349
I don't know.

1190
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,270
I gotta be looking at a million.

1191
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:31,791
The naked eye can see 2,000.

1192
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:38,239
Well, then I really got great eyes
'cause I'm looking at a million.

1193
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:43,717
Alpha Centauri's the closest.
That's four and a half light years away.

1194
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,071
Four and a half? That's not bad.

1195
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:50,473
Each light year is six trillion miles,
so that's...

1196
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:54,197
twenty six trillion miles.

1197
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:58,671
- Twenty-six trillion. That's the closest?
- Yep.

1198
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:03,309
And there's one hundred billion stars
in our galaxy.

1199
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:08,077
There's more galaxies in the universe
than there are grains of sand on earth.

1200
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,434
That is big.

1201
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,190
- And we are small.
- Yeah.

1202
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:45,395
What the...

1203
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,355
People?

1204
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,909
People? People?

1205
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,594
- People?
- People?

1206
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:58,789
People! Hello!

1207
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,920
- Hello! Hello, down here!
- Hello!

1208
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:03,954
Help, please!

1209
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:06,116
Help!

1210
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:12,915
Hey, down there.

1211
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:15,190
You've got to be shitting me.

1212
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:17,435
What happened to your pants?

1213
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:21,280
- Uh, it's a long story.
- Copy that.

1214
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,071
You guys just stay put.
We'll get you out of there.

1215
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,679
- Nice fellas.
- Yeah.

1216
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:32,316
- I love those guys.
- Me, too.

1217
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:46,000
- You still got some of that jerky?
- Yeah.

1218
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:48,720
You still good on water?

1219
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,952
- About three-quarters. You?
- Yeah, same.

1220
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:02,040
- Hey, Stephen?
- Yeah?

1221
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,394
Do you want to go home?

1222
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:12,791
Yeah, I do. I really do.

1223
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,473
We weren't even close, were we?

1224
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,998
What are you talking about?
We did it, Bryson.

1225
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,395
We never even laid eyes on Mount Katahdin.

1226
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:35,920
Another mountain?
How many mountains do you need to see?

1227
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:41,391
- That's one way of looking at it.
- That's the only way of looking at it.

1228
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,551
As far as I'm concerned,
we walked the Appalachian Trail.

1229
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:47,956
We walked it in the heat,
we walked it in the snow,

1230
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:50,111
we walked it until our feet bled.

1231
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:54,358
We hiked the Appalachian Trail, Bryson.

1232
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:59,240
Maybe you're right.

1233
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,671
- You guys called a cab? All right.
- Yeah.

1234
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,153
This thing's heavy.
You been carrying it awhile?

1235
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:21,959
All the way from Georgia.

1236
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:25,392
You don't say. Good for you, fellas.
Hey, where you guys from?

1237
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:26,955
Iowa.

1238
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:29,395
That's not possible.

1239
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,911
No such thing as a Red Sox fan from Iowa.

1240
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:44,074
Here you go.

1241
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:48,395
"Dearest Catherine..."
That's as far as you got?

1242
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,433
It's lucky we were saved.

1243
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,751
There are certain things
you just can't put into words.

1244
01:34:58,120 --> 01:34:59,600
Safe journey, okay?

1245
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,110
Yeah.

1246
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,197
You still owe me 600 bucks.

1247
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,718
You know I'm good for it, right?

1248
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:19,476
