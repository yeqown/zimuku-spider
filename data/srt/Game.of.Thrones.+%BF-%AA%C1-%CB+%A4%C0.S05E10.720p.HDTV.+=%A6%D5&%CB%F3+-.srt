1
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,450
迎着风
Brace the wind.

2
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,900
陛下  光之王已经履行了承诺
The lord of light has made good on his promise, my king.

3
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,420
他的火焰已将冰雪消融
His fires have melted the snows away.

4
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,540
前路畅通无阻
The way ahead is clear.

5
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,120
我们进军临冬城
We ride for Winterfell.

6
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,760
您将一举夺下它
And you will take it.

7
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,260
光之王让我看到波顿的旗帜熊熊燃烧
The lord has shown me Bolton Banners burning.

8
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,230
您将得到本应属于您的东西
You will receive what is yours by right.

9
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,430
陛下
Your grace.

10
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,510
准备行军
Prepare to form up.

11
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,520
陛下
Your grace.

12
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,850
讲
Tell me.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,700
士卒  黎明前逃走了很多
The men, many deserted before dawn.

14
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,310
有多少
How many?

15
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,230
将近半数
Nearly half.

16
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,820
所有佣兵和全部的马匹
All the sellswords with all the horses.

17
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,730
陛下
Your grace.

18
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,530
尽管说  总不会比兵变更糟
Speak up. Can't be worse than mutiny.

19
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,900
把她放下来
Cut her down.

20
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,620
陛下
Your grace.

21
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,420
有人看到梅莉珊卓女士骑马出了营地
The lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.

22
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,100
传令集合  准备行军
Get the men into marching formation.

23
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,440
向临冬城进发
On to Winterfell.

24
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,940
他双手一扬
He raised his hands

25
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,550
它们一下子都站了起来
and they all stood up at once.

26
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,560
成千上万  世界上最庞大的军队
Tens of thousands of them. The biggest army in the world.

27
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,680
你打算怎么做
So what are you gonna do?

28
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,470
我打算祈祷它们别学会爬长城
I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the Wall.

29
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,930
但是龙晶...
But the dragonglass...

30
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,110
没人拿得回来了
No one's ever getting that back now.

31
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,340
反正也是杯水车薪
It wouldn't have mattered anyway.

32
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,870
除非我们有座龙晶山
Not unless we had a mountain of it.

33
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,700
可你杀死了一个异鬼
But you killed a white walker.

34
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,150
用的是长爪
With Longclaw.

35
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,910
我眼见钢斧在他们面前如玻璃般粉碎
I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass.

36
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,880
-可长爪...  -是瓦雷利亚钢
- But Longclaw... - is Valyrian steel.

37
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,620
七国上下还有多少把瓦雷利亚钢剑
How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?

38
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,920
远远不够
Not enough.

39
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,040
有史以来第一个牺牲誓言兄弟性命
The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice

40
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,850
去救野人的总司令
the lives of sworn brothers to save the lives of wildlings.

41
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,840
跟黑城堡最遭憎恨的人做朋友感觉如何
How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?

42
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,980
我刚到这儿你就是我朋友了
You were friends with me when I first came here.

43
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,260
那时候可没什么人喜欢我
And I wasn't winning any elections back then.

44
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,770
那么这一杯敬我们
Here's to us, then.

45
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,580
但凭他们嘲笑吧
Long may they sneer.

46
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:02,970
怎么了
What?

47
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,850
我想求你一件事
I wanted to ask you something.

48
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,390
求你为我做件事
To ask something of you.

49
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,620
送我  吉莉和孩子去旧镇
Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown

50
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,280
让我受训成为学士
so I can become a maester.

51
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,410
那才是我天生该做的事  不是打仗
That's what I'm meant to be. Not this.

52
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,370
这里需要你  山姆
I need you here, Sam.

53
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,070
要是你走了  还有谁能给我可信的忠告
If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?

54
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,750
还有艾迪啊
Well, there's Edd.

55
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,550
我成为学士对你更有用
I'd be more use to you as a maester.

56
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,690
对大家都更有用  伊蒙学士不在了
More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon is gone.

57
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,480
学城有世界上最大的图书馆
The Citadel has the world's greatest library.

58
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,890
我会学习历史
I'll learn about history,

59
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,810
策略  医术
strategy, healing.

60
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,000
还有其他知识
And other things,

61
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,060
到时候用得上的
things that will help when--

62
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,780
那些东西来的时候
when they come.

63
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,110
如果吉莉留在这里  她会死的
If Gilly stays here, then she'll die.

64
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,450
她以我的名字命名的孩子也会死
And the baby that she named after me will die.

65
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,340
我也会死  为了保护他们
And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them.

66
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,430
那样的话  我在世上最后所见
Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world

67
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,410
将是我没能保护他们时她的眼神
will be the look in her eyes when I fail them.

68
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,110
我宁愿面对一千异鬼  也不愿见到那一幕
And I'd rather see a thousand white walkers than see that.

69
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,580
谢谢你
Thank you.

70
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,960
你知道学城也会让你发誓不近女色
You know that the Citadel will make you swear off women, too.

71
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,820
他们可以试啊
Oh, they'll bloody try.

72
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,330
-山姆  -怎么啦
- Sam. - What?

73
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,890
山姆
Sam.

74
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,440
你那时刚被打了个半死  你是怎么...
You had just been beaten half to death. How did you--

75
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,260
小心翼翼呗
Oh, very carefully.

76
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,850
真高兴在末日劫难之时还有人交了好运
I'm glad the end of the world's working out well for someone.

77
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,520
我会回来的
I'll come back.

78
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,880
敬你归来
To your return.

79
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,170
敬我归来
To my return.

80
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,970
这边
Aye, this way.

81
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,970
小姐
My lady!

82
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,160
史坦尼斯
Stannis.

83
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,030
史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩来了  带着军队
Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.

84
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,290
你怎么知道是史坦尼斯
How do you know it's Stannis?

85
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,270
他们举着烈焰红心旗
They're carrying his flaming heart banners.

86
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,790
我在黑水河上见过  一辈子也忘不了
From the Blackwater. I'll never forget it.

87
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,290
在这里挖战壕
Trench here.

88
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,090
距城墙三百码再挖一道
Another one 300 yards from the castle wall.

89
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,300
让他们快点儿
Hurry them along.

90
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,120
在两坡之间挖
Dig between those two rises.

91
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,940
-传令下去  -我跟你走
- Spread out. - I'm with you.

92
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,410
-弓箭手  -传令下去
- Archers! - Spread out!

93
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,770
马上派人出去征收粮草
And send out a foraging party immediately.

94
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,530
日出开始围攻
Siege begins at sunrise.

95
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,910
不会有围攻了  陛下
There's not going to be a siege, Your Grace.

96
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,260
我们毫无胜算
We've got no chance!

97
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,590
不要  求你
No, please, please.

98
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,170
波顿还找了女人替他打仗
Bolton has women fighting for him?

99
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,530
我不为波顿家效命
I don't fight for the Boltons.

100
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,660
我是塔斯的布蕾妮
I'm Brienne of Tarth.

101
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,540
我本是蓝礼·拜拉席恩的彩虹护卫
I was kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.

102
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:03,370
那个有你容貌的影子刺杀他时  我也在场
I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face.

103
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,890
你使用血魔法杀了他吗
You murdered him with blood magic?

104
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,760
是的
I did.

105
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,180
以蓝礼·拜拉席恩一世
In the name of Renly of house Baratheon, first of his name,

106
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,610
安达尔人和先民的真王
rightful king of the Andals and the First Men,

107
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,890
七国的统治者暨全境守护之名
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm,

108
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,430
我  塔斯的布蕾妮  判你死刑
I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die.

109
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,160
你可有遗言
Do you have any last words?

110
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,180
来吧  履行你的职责
Go on, do your duty.

111
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,240
看来我们的活儿干完了
Looks like we're done here.

112
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,180
我投降  我投降
I surrender! I surrender!

113
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,250
我接受你的投降
And I accept your surrender.

114
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,080
我们回去吧
Let's head back.

115
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,200
我妻子一定孤单了
My wife must be lonely.

116
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,330
夫人
My lady.

117
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,700
我来送您回房间去
I've come to escort you back to your chamber.

118
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,380
跟她走吧  拜托
Go with her, please.

119
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,920
我知道拉姆斯的本性
I know what Ramsay is.

120
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,140
我知道他会怎么待我
I know what he'll do to me.

121
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,210
如果注定要死
If I'm going to die,

122
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,110
就让我趁还没完全失却本心前死掉
let it happen while there's still some of me left.

123
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,320
死
Die?

124
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,340
谁说你要死了
Who said anything about dying?

125
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,850
你不能死
You can't die.

126
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,950
你父亲是北境守护
Your father was Warden of the North.

127
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,320
拉姆斯需要你
Ramsay needs you.

128
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,250
不过他应该不需要完整的你
Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you.

129
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,740
只需要为他生育子嗣的那些部分
Just the parts he'll use to make his heir,

130
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,160
等你生了一两个儿子  就没有使用价值了
until you've given him a boy or two and he's finished using them.

131
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,580
然后怎么处置那些部分  他自有好点子呢
Then he's got incredible plans for those parts.

132
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,220
所以  我们是等他回来
So, shall we wait for him to come back

133
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,820
还是这就开始
or should we begin now?

134
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,750
你要我决定吗
You're leaving it to me?

135
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,700
太好了
Good.

136
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,840
我们开始吧
Let's begin.

137
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,270
臭佬  住手
Reek... stop!

138
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,030
住手
Stop!

139
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,150
打开大门
Open the gate!

140
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,290
他回来了
He's coming back.

141
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,670
看来我有的忙活了
I can see I have my work cut out for me.

142
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,910
你俩  出去
You two, out.

143
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,090
你是我名单上的第一个
You were the first person on my list, you know.

144
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,610
你杀了西利欧·佛瑞尔  记得他吗
For killing Syrio Forel. Remember him?

145
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,760
很可能不记得了
Probably not.

146
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,900
还有其他几个人
I've gotten a few of the others.

147
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,930
千面之神偷走了几个
The many-faced god stole a few more from me.

148
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,130
但他把你留给我  我很高兴
But I'm glad he left me you.

149
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,700
你知道我是谁吗
Do you know who I am?

150
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,520
我听不到
I can't hear you.

151
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,530
你知道我是谁
You know who I am.

152
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,420
我是艾莉亚·史塔克
I'm Arya Stark.

153
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,690
你知道你是谁吗
Do you know who you are?

154
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,240
你是无名之辈
You're no one.

155
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,620
你什么也不是
You're nothing.

156
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,580
女孩夺走了一条命
A girl has taken a life.

157
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,260
不该夺的命
The wrong life.

158
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,850
我说对了
I was right about her.

159
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,010
是啊
You were.

160
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,780
你还没准备好
You're not ready.

161
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,370
根本没准备好
Not at all.

162
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,090
那人的命不该由你取
That man's life was not yours to take.

163
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,060
女孩偷了千面之神的东西
A girl stole from the many-faced god.

164
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,180
如今债已欠下
Now a debt is owed.

165
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,660
只有死亡能还人命债
Only death can pay for life.

166
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,010
不要
No! No!

167
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,450
不要  你不能死  别死啊
No, you... don't die! Don't die!

168
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,130
你为什么要哭
Why are you crying?

169
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,200
他是我朋友
He was my friend.

170
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,810
不  他不是  你没听他说什么吗
No, he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?

171
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,490
他是无名之辈
He was no one.

172
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,310
可如果你是...
But if you're...

173
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,520
这是谁
Who's this?

174
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,380
无名之辈
No one at all.

175
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,190
女孩也该做无名之辈
Just as a girl should have been

176
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,090
才能拿走大厅里的脸
before she took a face from the hall.

177
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,060
脸是给无名之辈的
The faces are for no one.

178
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,000
而你仍是有名之人
You are still someone.

179
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,400
对于有名之人
And to someone,

180
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,830
脸与毒药无异
the faces are as good as poison.

181
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,130
我看不到了
I can't see.

182
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,790
怎么回事
What's happening?

183
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,830
怎么回事
What's happening?!

184
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:51,250
-祝你返乡顺利  -谢谢
- I wish you a safe journey home. - Thank you.

185
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,790
原谅我  孩子
Forgive me, child.

186
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,420
我衷心祝你幸福快乐
I wish you all the happiness in the world.

187
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,920
或许我改日会来看你
Maybe I'll come visit you sometime.

188
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,110
或许我会去看你
Maybe I'll come visit you.

189
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,590
别等太久
Don't wait too long.

190
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,880
家里还有个贵妇人等着我娶
Got a noblewoman to marry back home.

191
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,280
你想要个清白的姑娘
You want a good girl,

192
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,350
但也缺不了坏坏的小婊子
but you need the bad pussy.

193
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,590
准备好了就出发  大人
Whenever you're ready, my lord.

194
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,930
别再把它弄丢了
Try not to lose it this time.

195
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,800
我再也不会取下来了
I'll never take it off again.

196
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,960
我知道你并不希望离开多恩
I know you didn't want to leave Dorne,

197
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,880
但我很高兴你能回家
but I'm glad you're coming home.

198
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,410
你母亲迫切地想要见你
Your mother's desperate to see you.

199
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,400
很高兴崔斯丹与我们同行
I'm glad Trystane is coming with us.

200
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,950
他看上去是个好小子
He seems like a nice boy.

201
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,160
你很幸运
You're lucky.

202
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,630
指定的婚姻很少能...
Arranged marriages are rarely so--

203
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,470
指得这么好
so well arranged.

204
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,220
你觉得母亲会喜欢他吗
Do you think mother will like him?

205
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:26,130
只要她看到你幸福  我相信她会的
If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will.

206
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,840
你真的这么想
You really believe that?

207
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,390
你想想  除了她的孩子们
Have you ever known your mother to like anyone

208
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,090
你母亲还喜欢过谁
aside from her children?

209
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,560
她喜欢你
She likes you.

210
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,850
这我可不敢肯定
I'm not so sure about that.

211
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,670
听着
Listen...

212
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,070
我想告诉你一件事
There's something I wanted to tell you.

213
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,750
很久以前就应该告诉你了
Something I should have told you long ago.

214
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,070
怎么说呢
So...

215
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,920
既然你如今的阅历也广了些
Now that you've seen more of the world,

216
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,390
想必也知道世事有多复杂
you've learned how complicated things can be,

217
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,940
人心有多难测
people can be.

218
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,830
兰尼斯特家和马泰尔家多年来相互仇视
The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years,

219
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,020
但你却与崔斯丹坠入爱河
but you've fallen in love with Trystane.

220
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,670
这是机缘巧合  真的  这可能性多小啊
It was an accident, really. I mean, what were the chances?

221
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,460
你碰巧爱上了那个
You happen to fall in love with the man

222
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,650
指给你的男人
you were assigned to marry?

223
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,390
我想说的是...
My point is...

224
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,000
我们无法选择自己所爱的人
We don't choose whom we love.

225
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,010
这只是...
It just, well--

226
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,540
我们不能自持
It's beyond our control.

227
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,520
-我真像个傻瓜  -不  没有的事
- I sound like an idiot. - No, you don't.

228
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,120
我想说的是...我想表达
What I'm trying to say-- what I'm trying

229
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,430
却又难以启齿的是...
and failing to say--

230
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,770
我知道你想说什么
I know what you're trying to say.

231
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,890
不  恐怕你不懂
No, I'm afraid you don't.

232
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,820
我懂
I do.

233
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,400
我都知道
I know.

234
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,440
你和母亲的事
About you and mother.

235
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:50,120
我想我内心深处早就知道了
I think a part of me always knew.

236
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,070
并且  我很庆幸
And I'm glad.

237
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,400
我很庆幸你是我的父亲
I'm glad that you're my father.

238
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,700
弥赛菈
Myrcella?

239
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,530
弥赛菈
Myrcella?

240
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,250
弥赛菈  弥赛菈
Myrcella? Myrcella?

241
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,360
你们爱她  不是吗
You love her, don't you?

242
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,040
怎么能不爱她
How could you not?

243
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,400
当然你们的爱都是无望的
Of course it's hopeless for the both of you.

244
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,570
一个是斗技场的佣兵  一个是不名誉的骑士
A sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight.

245
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,200
谁都不适合成为女王的好夫君
Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen.

246
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:32,770
但我们谁没有奢求一份错位的爱情呢
But we always want the wrong woman.

247
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,310
他总是这么喜欢废话吗
Does he always talk so much?

248
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,810
安达尔人乔拉
Jorah the Andal.

249
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,720
灰虫子
Torgo Nudho.

250
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,240
他不该在这儿
He should not be here.

251
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,750
没错  但他就在这儿
No, but he is.

252
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,300
女王已下令将他逐出城外
Our queen ordered him exiled from city.

253
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,800
若不是有他  女王就死了
Our queen would be dead if not for him.

254
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,910
{\pos(193,245)}真的  而我  如果不是这个...

255
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,750
{\pos(193,245)}小个子

256
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,320
{\pos(193,245.6)}侏儒

257
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,480
{\pos(193,245)}应该是这个词

258
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,240
{\pos(193,245)}不好意思

259
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,920
{\pos(193,245)}我的瓦雷利亚语有点森苏

260
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,920
{\pos(193,245)}有点生疏

261
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,910
生疏  谢谢你
Punila. Thank you.

262
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,830
我很遗憾
I am sorry.

263
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,590
当时我不在场  不能为女王而战
Sorry I not there to fight for our queen.

264
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,880
你错过了一场精彩的斗殴
You missed a good scrap.

265
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,110
这些都不重要了
None of that matters now.

266
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,930
我们在这儿自怨自艾
The longer we sit here bantering,

267
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:28,490
丹妮莉丝还困在蛮荒之地遭罪
the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.

268
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,870
他说的没错  龙飞向北边
He's right. The dragon headed north.

269
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,810
如果我们要找她  就得往北走
If we're going to find her, that's where we'll have to go.

270
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,940
"我们"
We?

271
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,970
你是兰尼斯特
You're a Lannister.

272
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,710
女王力求推翻你们家族的统治
The queen intends to remove your family from power.

273
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,550
而我要助她得偿所愿
And I intend to help her do it.

274
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,630
你来这儿才几天
You've been here for how many days now?

275
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,690
我为她而战已有多年
I've fought for her for years.

276
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,670
最早的时候她不比孩子大多少
Since she was little more than a child.

277
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,560
-你背叛过她  -说话小心点
- You betrayed her. - Careful now.

278
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,140
她放逐了你  两次  如果我没记错的话
And she exiled you. Twice, I believe.

279
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,670
第二次还是多亏了你呢
The second time thanks to you.

280
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,230
别把你犯下的罪行归咎到我头上  莫尔蒙
Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont.

281
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:58,060
他说的对  女王放逐了乔拉
He's right. Our queen exiled Jorah.

282
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,410
但他说的也没错  乔拉救过她的命
And he's right. Jorah saved her life.

283
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,020
或许女王对他的看法已经有所改变了
Perhaps she feels differently about him now.

284
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:06,200
或许不然  但我们要问过她才会知道
Perhaps not. The only way we'll know is if we ask her.

285
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,070
好吧  或许他可以跟我们一起
Fine, fine. I suppose he can join us.

286
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,910
只要他答应别趁我睡觉时杀了我就行
Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.

287
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,930
如果我要杀你  你的眼睛一定睁着
If I ever kill you, your eyes will be wide open.

288
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,830
恕我直言  我们为何要带上你
Forgive me, but why would we bring you?

289
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,760
-什么  -你在野外追踪过野兽吗
- Pardon me? - Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?

290
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:25,680
那倒没有  但我还有别的实用技能
Not precisely, but I have other skills that would be useful.

291
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,900
你能战斗吗
Can you fight?

292
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,030
我战斗过
I have fought.

293
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,020
我没有自称是伟大的战士
I don't claim to be a great warrior.

294
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,640
你骑术如何
Are you good on a horse?

295
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,320
马马虎虎
Middling.

296
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,010
所以你基本上只会耍嘴皮子
So mainly you talk.

297
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:39,060
还会喝酒  我都活这么久了
And drink. I've survived so far.

298
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,300
我对此深为佩服  但这次远征要你无用
Which I respect, but you would not help us on this expedition.

299
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,270
你留在弥林却可以帮助我们
You would help us here in Meereen, though.

300
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:49,260
我们都没有治理城邦的经验
None of us have experience governing a city

301
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,430
除了他
except for him.

302
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,280
你不是想向女王证明自己的价值吗
You want to prove your value to the queen?

303
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,800
就在弥林证明吧
Prove it right here in Meereen.

304
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,480
他是个连当地语言都说不利索的异邦侏儒
He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language.

305
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,020
弥林人凭什么听他的
Why would the Meereenese listen to him?

306
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,190
他们不听他的
They wouldn't.

307
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,810
他们会听灰虫子的
They will listen to Grey Worm.

308
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,110
我要和你们同去
I'll come with you.

309
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,100
我要找到女王
I'll find our queen.

310
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,020
-你的身体状况还不能出行  -我可以
- You are not strong enough to go anywhere. - I am.

311
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,730
他可以  他是我见过的最有种的阉人
He is. He's the toughest man with no balls I ever met.

312
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,570
可你还是不能去
But you still can't go.

313
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,920
这里的人民信任你
The people believe in you.

314
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,930
他们知道你是女王的代言人
They know you speak for the queen.

315
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,960
没错
It's true.

316
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,450
只有无垢者能维持弥林的和平
Only the unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen.

317
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,220
如果你离开
If you leave,

318
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,570
弥林肯定一分为二  自相残杀
half this city will consume the other half.

319
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,190
还有弥桑黛
And Missandei.

320
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,630
女王最信任的人是弥桑黛
Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei.

321
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,540
肯定不是我
Certainly not me.

322
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,610
女王最亲近的密友
The queen's closest confidante,

323
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,280
无垢者的指挥官
the commander of the unsullied,

324
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,090
以及来自异邦的疤脸侏儒
and a foreign dwarf with a scarred face.

325
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,930
祝你们好运  我的朋友们
Good fortune, my friends.

326
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:45,190
弥林古老而荣耀
Meereen is ancient and glorious.

327
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,170
尽量别毁了她
Try not to ruin her.

328
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,570
看来只有你我二人了  安达尔人乔拉
Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal.

329
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,250
我们去找几匹好马
Let's find some good horses.

330
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,970
路上还有说不完的话呢
We have so much to talk about.

331
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,760
你好啊  老朋友
Hello, old friend.

332
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,110
我还以为我们在一起很快乐
I thought we were so happy together

333
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,410
结果你抛弃了我
until you abandoned me.

334
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:40,060
我猜没必要问你是怎么找到我的
I suppose there's no point asking how you found me.

335
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,670
西边的鸟儿会唱歌  东边的鸟儿也会唱
The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east,

336
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,470
只要你懂得如何聆听
if one knows how to listen.

337
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,350
听说你已经获得了龙之母的垂青
They tell me you've already found favor with the mother of dragons.

338
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,430
怎么说呢  她没有处决我
Well, she didn't execute me,

339
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,650
算是开了个好头
so that's a promising start.

340
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,120
现在英雄们去找她了
Now the heroes are off to find her

341
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:00,000
而我困守在此
and I'm stuck here

342
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,540
意欲挽救本城于内战边缘
trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war.

343
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,620
老朋友有什么建议给我吗
Any advice for an old comrade?

344
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,080
情报是关键
Information is the key.

345
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,950
你需要了解敌人的优势和策略
You need to learn your enemy's strengths and strategies.

346
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:13,100
你需要知晓哪位朋友笑里藏刀
You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.

347
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:17,750
但愿我认识一个触角无所不至的能人
If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.

348
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,260
但愿如此
If only.

349
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,200
一座雄伟的古城
A grand old city

350
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,220
因暴力  腐败和欺骗而濒临崩溃
choking on violence, corruption, and deceit.

351
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,100
谁有经验驯服
Who could possibly have any experience

352
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,180
如此巨大而蠢笨的野兽呢
managing such a massive, ungainly beast?

353
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,810
我真心想念你
I did miss you.

354
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,590
噢  我知道
Oh, I know.

355
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,170
我们必须回家
We have to go home.

356
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,230
可怜又可爱的孩子
Oh, my poor, sweet thing.

357
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,880
疼吗
Does it hurt?

358
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,510
我们必须回家
We have to go home.

359
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,350
卓耿
Drogon.

360
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,280
你能带我回弥林吗
Can you take me back to Meereen?

361
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,650
你带我飞了多远
How far did you carry me?

362
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,590
卓耿  我们得回去
Drogon, we need to return.

363
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,470
我的人民需要我
My people need me.

364
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,170
这里没有食物
Well, there's no food.

365
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:27,140
你至少给我们捕些晚饭回来啊
At the very least, you could hunt us some supper.

366
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,320
忏悔
Confess.

367
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,700
忏悔
Confess.

368
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,850
我有罪
I have sinned.

369
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,940
我现在知道了
I see that now.

370
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,900
我怎会糊涂那么久
How can I have been so blind for so long?

371
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,670
我想清洁自己
I want to be clean again.

372
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,200
我想获得赦免
I want absolution.

373
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,860
老妪高举金灯来到我面前
The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high.

374
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,960
让沐浴圣光的...
And by its holy light--

375
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,790
您想忏悔
You wish to make a confession?

376
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,350
我忏悔之后  能否放了我
Once I've confessed, will I be free?

377
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:57,320
对陛下的处置将视陛下的罪行而定
Your grace will be dealt with according to her sins.

378
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,470
那么愿圣母慈悲
The Mother have mercy, then.

379
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,600
我忏悔  我在婚外出轨
I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage. I confess.

380
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,770
跟谁
Name him.

381
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,730
蓝赛尔·兰尼斯特
Lancel Lannister.

382
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:17,950
您的堂弟  国王的侍从
Your cousin and the king's squire.

383
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:20,590
-我那时孤单害怕  -您有丈夫
- I was lonely and afraid. - You had a husband.

384
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,550
一个成天狎妓的丈夫...
A husband off whoring every chance he--

385
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,970
他的罪无法抵消您的罪
His sins do not pardon your own.

386
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,460
愿诸神宽恕我
May the gods forgive me.

387
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,110
其他男人呢
Other men?

388
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,020
没有了
No.

389
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:37,910
没有别人了吗
No others?

390
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:40,950
没有了
No.

391
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:44,910
在诸神面前撒谎可是大罪
Speaking falsehoods before the gods is a great crime.

392
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,850
您明白吧
You understand this?

393
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:47,960
明白
I do.

394
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:52,370
有人说您的孩子
There are those that say your children

395
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,640
并非您与劳勃国王所生
were not fathered by King Robert,

396
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,080
而是通奸乱伦的孽种
that they are bastards born of incest and adultery.

397
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,280
谎言
A lie.

398
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,980
史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩的无耻谎言
A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon.

399
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,020
他妄图篡夺铁王座
He wants the throne,

400
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,960
但他哥哥的孩子阻碍他即位
but his brother's children stand in his way.

401
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,190
所以他污蔑他们是野种
So he claims they are not his brother's.

402
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,530
那个混蛋
That filth.

403
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,810
根本就是一派胡言
There is not one shred of truth to it.

404
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,180
我否认
I deny it.

405
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:19,730
很好
Good.

406
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,200
但这些罪名极为严重
But these are terrible charges.

407
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,280
七国子民必须知道真相
And the realm must know the truth of them.

408
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,250
若陛下所言非虚
If Your Grace has given honest testimony,

409
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,420
审判必将还您清白
your trial will prove your innocence.

410
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,960
审判  我已经忏悔了
Trial? I have confessed.

411
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,300
只是其中一项罪名
To a single sin.

412
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,600
其余的您都否认了
Others you have denied.

413
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:42,370
审判将辨明真伪
Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.

414
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:47,600
谨遵总主教大人的英明裁断
I bow to the wisdom of your high holiness.

415
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,340
但我可否请求
But if I might beg

416
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,750
圣母稍示慈悲
for just one drop of the Mother's Mercy.

417
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,000
我都不知多久
I haven't seen my son--

418
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,930
没见过我的儿子了
I don't know how long it's been.
