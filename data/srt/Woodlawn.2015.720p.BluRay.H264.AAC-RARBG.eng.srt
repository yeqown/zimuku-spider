1
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,949
If you'd have asked me
in 1973 if I believed in miracles,

2
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,870
I'd have said absolutely not.

3
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,480
I'd have told you it's a brutal world
out there, and my only comfort in it

4
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,000
is that I am the master of my own fate.

5
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,080
I'm the captain of my soul.

6
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,800
Some call what happened here a miracle,

7
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,560
and there is only one explanation,

8
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,631
only one way any of this
could've happened.

9
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,320
In the city of Birmingham,

10
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,120
the Department of Justice some time ago

11
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,560
instituted an investigation,

12
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,710
an attack on the city's
segregation ordinance.

13
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,720
I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama.

14
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,080
Some very, very good friends
of mine were killed by bombs,

15
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,240
bombs that were planted by racists.

16
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,240
I remember,
from the time I was very small,

17
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,960
I remember the sounds of bombs
exploding across the street,

18
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,710
our house shaking.

19
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,760
So what do you expect
with that type of injustice?

20
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,920
We are angry.

21
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,160
They killed Kennedy.
They killed King.

22
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,800
They killed Evers.

23
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,760
I don't think there is much
of a future at this point.

24
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,400
Not much at all.

25
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,787
They're just killing
everybody that wanna...

26
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,868
For the nation itself.

27
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,360
The true picture of what goes on here

28
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,040
can even be seen in American television.

29
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,760
If you look at it long enough,
the emptiness,

30
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,960
the spiritual bleakness,
the loss of meaning,

31
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,600
the loss of purpose.

32
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,200
There's no unity in the world.

33
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,840
You couldn't rally 500 people
to sincerely fight

34
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,760
for the same common cause,

35
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,520
no matter what that cause
might be, unless it's dollars.

36
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,800
The result of this is, of course,
the chaos that we live in.

37
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,560
They set fire to the country.

38
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,360
Get ridiculed, and you know,
discriminated, you know,

39
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,040
and be less than a man.

40
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,920
I don't think it's right, you know?

41
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,520
I draw the line in the dust
and toss the gauntlet

42
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,560
before the feet of tyranny,

43
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,280
and I say segregation now,
segregation tomorrow,

44
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,826
and segregation forever.

45
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,120
It's a sad day here in Birmingham,
a heartbreaking day,

46
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,560
the Crimson Tide about to be defeated
by the Trojans of Southern Cal

47
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,160
and their stellar tailback,
Sam "Bam" Cunningham.

48
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:31,266
A tough loss for
the Alabama Crimson Tide.

49
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,800
What happened, Coach?

50
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,028
We just got the stew
beat out of us by USC.

51
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,640
You weren't paying attention?

52
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,440
Why'd you bring USC to Birmingham?

53
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,120
Trying to make some sort of statement?

54
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,302
That's it, son.

55
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,120
We have a visitor.

56
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:06,920
Gentlemen, if wanting to win is a fault,

57
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,760
then I plead guilty.
I like to win.

58
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,800
Know no other way.

59
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,320
It's in my blood.

60
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:21,520
When I get beat, which
is gonna happen occasionally,

61
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:27,866
I like it to be by an opponent
worthy of my respect.

62
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,880
Fine game, son.

63
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,520
Thank you, sir.

64
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,920
Brave of you to play it.

65
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,800
Thank y'all for coming down here.

66
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,840
Where you been, Coach?

67
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,000
Talking to a real football player.

68
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,000
Time and a place for everything.

69
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,546
Ain't that what the Good Book says?

70
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,840
In memory of the 10-year
anniversary of the bombing

71
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,040
of the 16th Street
Baptist Church in Birmingham,

72
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,400
here's the late
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

73
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,120
DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.:
What murdered these four girls?

74
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,000
The apathy and the complacency
of many Negro

75
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,680
who will sit down on
their stools and do nothing

76
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,040
and not engage in creative protests

77
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,586
to get rid of this evil system.

78
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,591
Tell your mom I'll be home late.

79
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,760
Nobody forcing you to play.
You know that, right?

80
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,400
You sound like Mama now.

81
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,240
She just don't wanna see you get hurt.

82
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,280
That's just natural.

83
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,382
Hey, Tony.

84
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,504
Where you live from?

85
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,790
Love you, boy.

86
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,240
I'm frustrated all the time
by what I see,

87
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,550
and wonder when it'll end
and if it ever will end.

88
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,840
What do you think?

89
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,068
It's unbelievable.

90
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,320
What's the name of the school?

91
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,104
Woodlawn.

92
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,480
Listen up, guys.
Listen up.

93
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,920
Morton.

94
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,920
Allyson.

95
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,840
Parker.

96
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,590
Parker?

97
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,222
Anger.

98
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,662
I see it in your faces.

99
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,751
You're angry because of what's
happened to this school.

100
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,022
You've been berated...

101
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,942
or beaten...

102
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,182
or shot at.

103
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,280
So have I.

104
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,360
None of us chose this.

105
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,240
It was forced on us.

106
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,320
But we can choose together
what we will do with it.

107
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,080
So, if it is anger that unites us,

108
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,184
then let's use that anger to win, boys.

109
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,664
'Cause winning fixes just
about everything, doesn't it?

110
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,829
Are there any questions?

111
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,080
I didn't think so.
Let's go do it.

112
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,640
Sweet home Alabama

113
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,880
Where the skies are so blue

114
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,080
It's not that hot out here, boy.
Come on, let's go!

115
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,440
Sweet home Alabama

116
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,510
Lord, I'm coming home to you

117
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,184
Stay down, boy.
You don't belong.

118
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,760
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

119
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,880
That's my boy!

120
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,720
- You see that?
- I'm right here, Jerry.

121
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,360
Hey, it's okay, cupcake.

122
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,960
That was just Superman
flying over your head.

123
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,600
It's not your fault.

124
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,350
Watch your mouth, boy!

125
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,960
Hey! Hey!
That's enough!

126
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,200
Suicides, everybody, thanks to you two.

127
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,240
Let's go.

128
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,040
Look at the man beside you.

129
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,040
This is what happens when
you fight against each other

130
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,240
instead of fighting to be a team.

131
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,104
You shower when we're done, Superman.

132
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,263
Over, under, through, and tie.

133
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,160
Let me help you.

134
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,800
I don't wanna go.

135
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,640
It's okay.

136
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,960
Your school is not like my school.

137
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,710
Will it ever be?

138
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,560
Over, under, through.

139
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,760
Ready?

140
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,000
Yes, sir.

141
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,704
Let's go.

142
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,864
See ya, buddy.

143
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,600
Mornin'.

144
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,464
In whose world?

145
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:12,320
I am Coach Gerelds.

146
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,360
I love football and not science,
so please pay attention

147
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,320
while I give you all the answers.

148
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,040
Okay, let's get started.

149
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,960
Hey, you gonna quit?

150
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,680
Why?

151
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,000
It's what y'all do.

152
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,470
Come in.

153
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,320
Hey, Coach.

154
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,440
I'm Hank.

155
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,440
So, you're making plays?

156
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,120
Mm-hmm.

157
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,120
Yeah.

158
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,985
Look, I know you're a busy man,
so I'll get right to the point.

159
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,520
I'd like to have a meeting
with your football team.

160
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,240
About what?

161
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,920
Jesus Christ.

162
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,000
Oh, wow, what are you,
some kind of preacher or something?

163
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,120
No, no, not a preacher.

164
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,200
I'm a sports chaplain, actually.

165
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,120
I like to find different
teams to work with.

166
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,320
I just wanna talk to 'em.

167
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,424
Well, I'm sorry, Hank, but you can't.

168
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,560
You know this is a public school?

169
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,840
Yeah.

170
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,920
Yeah, I know.

171
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,280
Look, I've seen some things
all over the country.

172
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:23,280
I've seen amazing things.

173
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,320
Well, you are not gonna see them here.

174
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,160
I think your players could use it.

175
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,360
I think you could too.

176
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,920
Listen, Hank, if my team
needs something,

177
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,022
I will tell you.

178
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,800
Wait up, Johnnie.

179
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,040
So, who is she?

180
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,440
Her name Johnnie, I told you.

181
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,720
That's her real name?

182
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,640
That's the name she go by.

183
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,744
If you're so curious, why
don't you just ask her yourself?

184
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,440
Of course, that would
require you to actually talk,

185
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,160
or ride the bus with the rest of us.

186
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,910
I talk.

187
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,240
She don't even know you exist.

188
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,626
Nobody does.

189
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,760
How she gonna see what's invisible?

190
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,960
Reggie...

191
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,191
Hey, break it up!

192
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,424
Break it up, now!

193
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,160
I expect you to control
your school, son!

194
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:10,040
Five hundred kids getting bussed to
a place every day they don't wanna be.

195
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,720
Twenty-five hundred kids
don't want 'em here.

196
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,560
What did you think was gonna happen?

197
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,560
What's he talking for?
He ain't got a right here.

198
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,800
- I'm not gonna stand here...
- Let me deal with it.

199
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,600
I don't have to stand here
and be berated by this gentleman.

200
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,190
- Coach!
- I'm not done!

201
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,240
COACH! I could arrange that!

202
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,320
Now, who do you think you are?

203
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,960
Oh yeah, you're the assistant principal.

204
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,400
Only reason you are that is
'cause we ain't got nobody else.

205
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,504
Now, if you're done, I got
something to say to you.

206
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,080
The national spotlight is off
our city first time in a decade,

207
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,750
so I think it's time our town

208
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,600
came to its right and proper balance.

209
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,440
And if that means closing
the doors to this school,

210
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,542
well, so be it.

211
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,840
We've stayed.

212
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,600
While others have left, we've stayed.

213
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,704
And we stayed because
we love this school.

214
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,480
This school has been an enduring beacon

215
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:10,280
to this city for many years,
and we all know that.

216
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,000
Now, do you really want its final
legacy to be failed integration?

217
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,920
What would that do?

218
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,400
Why don't you tell me about that, sir?

219
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,664
All right, Tandy, I'll tell you.

220
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,840
If there is one more incident...

221
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,544
you're done.

222
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,800
Both of you.

223
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,440
Y'all have a nice day.

224
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,160
Thank you, Gene.
You too.

225
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,910
Mm-hmm.

226
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,024
Comin'!

227
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,880
Hello?

228
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,520
Hey, babe.

229
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,240
Hey, oh, hey, listen, Todd's got a Pop
Warner game now on Saturday at 3 p.m.

230
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,840
Now, you tell me you're gonna be there.

231
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,280
Look, something happened.
I'm okay, but...

232
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,520
What happened?

233
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,760
What always happens.

234
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,760
How bad?

235
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,909
Six went to the hospital.
Knives mostly.

236
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,560
You okay?

237
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,920
Let's go, Tandy.

238
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,022
Tandy, are you okay?

239
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,920
I gotta go.
Yeah, I'm okay. Bye.

240
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,960
Hey, Coach.

241
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,680
Can I talk to the team now?

242
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,280
Look, I don't have time
to deal with this right now.

243
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,280
Tandy, let's go.
Tandy, now!

244
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,640
Coach!

245
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,880
This is what I do.
I help people.

246
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,840
You know what?
You have five minutes.

247
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,480
After training in the gym.

248
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,240
You talk to Stearns.
You better be good.

249
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,944
Now!

250
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,680
Can I get an introduction?

251
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,430
No.

252
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,880
All right, guys, let's settle down.

253
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,240
Bring it in.
Guys.

254
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,800
Hey, hey!
Settle down.

255
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,080
We have a motivational speaker
here, if you guys don't mind.

256
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,680
Hey, guys.

257
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,560
I got it.

258
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,310
Good luck.

259
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,840
Hey, everybody. My name's Hank.

260
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,480
Hey, Hank.

261
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,480
I'm not a coach.
I'm not a teacher.

262
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,640
I'm not a counselor.

263
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:10,240
In fact, nobody asked me
to come here today.

264
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,680
But I look at what happened
this afternoon, and I think,

265
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,240
"Aren't you sick of it?"

266
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,880
I mean, I'm sick of it.

267
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,560
I'm not even from here,
but does this kind of thing

268
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:26,880
happen so much
that it just feels normal?

269
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,560
I mean, you don't know me,
you've never seen me before,

270
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,880
but what would you say if I
told you that 100% without fail,

271
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,631
it doesn't have to be this way?

272
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:45,760
Birmingham has seen
nothing but hate for so long,

273
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,520
it has lost its ability to believe.

274
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,280
It's lost hope.

275
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,880
Let me tell you what Jesus said.

276
00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:02,023
He said, "I am the way,
I am the truth, I am the life."

277
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,320
And that means something to me

278
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,880
because I let it mean something to me.

279
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,040
I'll tell you something else
that seems crazy, only it's not.

280
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,760
I love you.

281
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,400
I care about you,
each and every one of you.

282
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,640
I care about what you've seen.

283
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,270
I care about what you've been through.

284
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,920
I care about your pain.

285
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,240
So does God.

286
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,800
Jerry, what's going on?
I said 5 minutes.

287
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,440
He's been here for an hour.

288
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,640
We need to wrap this up.

289
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,280
Tandy, hold on, man.

290
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,640
Man, I know this sounds crazy,

291
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,040
but just give the guy a chance.

292
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,280
We ain't got nothing else to lose.

293
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,040
You don't know me,
but I'm asking you anyway

294
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,880
to stand up right now, right here,

295
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,240
and make a decision...

296
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,120
a decision to change, to forgive,

297
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:07,226
to be forgiven
no matter what you've done.

298
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,720
That's how much God loves you.

299
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:17,304
I'm asking you to choose Jesus.

300
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,600
Can you do that?

301
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,702
Will you do that...

302
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,662
with me, right now?

303
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,024
Thank you.

304
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,902
Brave men.

305
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,386
What just happened?

306
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,582
Where have you been?

307
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,840
The gym.

308
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,942
And what happened at the gym?

309
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:52,040
I let an untrained religious nut
convert the whole team.

310
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm going to bed.

311
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,580
The whole team.

312
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,200
Is that good or bad?

313
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,268
I don't know.

314
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:19,640
Birmingham Post Herald believes
something about this team.

315
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,360
They believe we're
only gonna win two games.

316
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,800
They believe that this season
is the death rattle

317
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,320
of a school that is
barely able to stay alive.

318
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,240
You see, I don't believe this
for a minute.

319
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,720
I believe that we are
the masters of our own fate.

320
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,667
I believe that we can prove
these people wrong.

321
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,880
Why don't you go out there and show me

322
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,840
what you all believe?

323
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,544
Let's go do it!

324
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,760
Play our boys!

325
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,510
Come on, Tandy!

326
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,800
Just no win.

327
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,320
Puts them black boys in, we riot.

328
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,920
He doesn't, they riot.

329
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,280
Bring 'em in, bring 'em in,
bring 'em in!

330
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,382
Bring 'em in!

331
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,240
Play our boys, Tandy!

332
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,160
I know you hear me!

333
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,280
Hey, sit down and shut up!

334
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,508
Hey, don't talk to my wife like that.

335
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,560
You don't talk to my wife like that.

336
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,720
I don't expect you to win,
but I expect you to keep things quiet.

337
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,680
It's not my fault, Owen.

338
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,080
I'm trying to coach football.

339
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,480
This is bigger than football, Tandy.

340
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,230
All right, then.

341
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,360
Get Nathan.

342
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,560
What?

343
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,310
Nathan!

344
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,400
Nathan, let's go.

345
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,880
Come on, son.
Let's go.

346
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,063
That's right.
Our boys wanna play too.

347
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,360
Hey, safety.

348
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,905
Go.

349
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,600
Field wrangler, cover two.

350
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,225
Field wrangler, cover two.

351
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,944
Ready, break!

352
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,720
Nathan!

353
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,360
The slot!

354
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,701
The slot, Nathan!

355
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,870
Hut!

356
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,227
Run! Go, Nathan!
Don't just stand there!

357
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,751
Go, go, go, go, go!

358
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,840
Come on, ref!
That was a late hit!

359
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,040
Are you kidding me?

360
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,790
Come on, Ref!

361
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,750
Welcome to the game.

362
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,200
I thought you said God
was gonna bless us.

363
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,360
I thought we were gonna win.

364
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,906
Maybe God is testing us.

365
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,200
Maybe he wants to know
that our commitment is real,

366
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,907
not just to win football games.

367
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,600
Look who decided to ride the bus today.

368
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,940
Hey, Johnnie, this is Tony.

369
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,040
He don't talk much.

370
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,869
I know who you are.

371
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,480
Really?

372
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,320
So, what you mean you don't talk, hmm?

373
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,880
It's 'cause you just ain't got nothing
to say or too afraid to say it?

374
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,480
Both.

375
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,280
Reggie, let him talk.

376
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,880
If you scored, we would've won the game.

377
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,000
Why you so afraid of getting hit?

378
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,080
'Cause it hurts.

379
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:06,040
That's too bad.

380
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,381
Ooh-hoo!

381
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,462
Hey, guys.

382
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,520
Hey, Tony, did you hear
about the meeting tonight?

383
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,240
Fellowship of Christian Athletes.

384
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,680
Count you in?

385
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,400
What happened to your foot?

386
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,640
Oh, when I was in college,
I was working part-time

387
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,200
during the summer at a steel mill.

388
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,480
Accident took away half my foot

389
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,640
and my dreams of playing
professional baseball.

390
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,040
Man, baseball was everything
to me back then.

391
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,200
Man, I'm sorry about that.

392
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,680
Don't be sorry.

393
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,400
I think that sometimes
before you can have

394
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,000
new dreams in this life,

395
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,240
the old ones have to be
taken away from you.

396
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,240
Look, there's something
I've wanted to say to you

397
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,344
since the first time I saw you play.

398
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,160
There's something
special about you, Tony.

399
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,360
I can see it.

400
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,280
You have a gift.

401
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,040
That's something that can't be taught.

402
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,760
That can only be given.

403
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:22,360
But you have to decide
what you wanna do with it.

404
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:28,400
When you play for yourself,
you can be great.

405
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,560
But when you play for something
higher than yourself,

406
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,664
that's when something
extraordinary can happen.

407
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,280
God has a purpose for all of us,

408
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,984
and it is not insignificant.

409
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:49,221
And obviously, I can't know
what yours is, but I think...

410
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,105
I think God wants you to be a superstar.

411
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,630
No such thing.

412
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,790
As what?

413
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,440
There's no such thing
as a black superstar.

414
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,941
Not in this state.

415
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,240
You okay, buddy?

416
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,786
I just hate to lose, Dad.

417
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,480
I hate it.

418
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,440
I hate it so bad.

419
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:40,080
You say you'll do anything
to win, but you won't.

420
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,182
Didn't you see him run?

421
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,750
Hike!

422
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,240
Come on, they're killing us!

423
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,880
If they're not gonna give him the ball,
this is just a waste of time, Junior.

424
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,640
We need a new coach!

425
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,629
Tandy, you're in trouble!

426
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,360
Time out. Time out.

427
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,747
Boys, bring it in.
Come here.

428
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,548
Nathan, come here.

429
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,760
This your time to shine, let's go.

430
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,120
That a boy, Tony!

431
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,920
Okay, Nathan's in at tailback.

432
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,160
Wait, wait, Coach!

433
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,440
Power I, guys.

434
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,720
Eleven yards, that's what I need, okay?

435
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,560
That's my position!
He don't know the offense yet!

436
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,520
Morton!
This is my team!

437
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:44,591
It's not a democracy!
Now go sit down!

438
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,040
All right, let's go.

439
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,142
Nathan.

440
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,400
You know what I believe?

441
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:01,120
That you are faster than them,
so you show me.

442
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,984
Yes, sir.

443
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,830
Tandy!

444
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,640
This is a contact sport, okay?

445
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,480
When someone wants to hit you,

446
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:36,000
it feels good to hit 'em
first, okay? Try it.

447
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,600
Atta boy, Tony!

448
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,280
Gonna be 1st down right now!

449
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,960
Tandy, put my boy in.

450
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,949
You're killing us!

451
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,464
Break!

452
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,222
That's my baby!

453
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,920
All right, let's punch it in.

454
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,022
Nathan, out.

455
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,310
Nice one, 22!

456
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,630
Hey, Tony.

457
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,960
How'd that feel?

458
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,710
Good.

459
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,429
Really good.

460
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,640
Come here, baby!

461
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,440
Momma is so proud of you.

462
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,360
Great game, son.
Great game.

463
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,000
Who is this?

464
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,720
This is Johnnie.

465
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,440
Hi.

466
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,480
Oh, she sure is pretty, Tony.

467
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,680
Oh, it's not like that.

468
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,240
What church you go to?

469
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,440
Momma!

470
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:00,000
No girl better even think about marrying
my Tony without being church-going.

471
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,600
I don't go to church.

472
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,600
Well, you gonna go to church with us.

473
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,240
And I see I'm a have to fatten you up,

474
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:09,624
'cause I don't know how you think you gonna
have my grandbabies with hips like that.

475
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,200
Uh, let's just let them be.

476
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,428
Yeah, well a closed mouth
don't get fed, Junior.

477
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,320
I want my boy to play college ball.

478
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,000
All right, he has that opportunity,

479
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,200
and I don't think it's right
that it's being taken away

480
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,880
by somebody who don't even belong.

481
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,720
I coach the team that I am given, Bull.

482
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,360
I coach to win.

483
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,960
That is my commitment
to myself, this school,

484
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,427
and every parent in it, including you.

485
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,360
Hey. Hey!

486
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,384
You gonna get that colored boy hurt.

487
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,880
Therefore, since we are surrounded

488
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,800
by such a great cloud of witnesses,

489
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,480
let us lay aside every weight.

490
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:54,160
We have to run this race
called life with patience.

491
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,880
Are you willing to run the race
and put down the shame?

492
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,600
Amen!

493
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,600
Turn to your neighbor
and say, "Put it down."

494
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,800
Put it down!

495
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,000
How many of y'all have a race
you know you got to run?

496
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:12,840
You think 'cause you
got that many races to run.

497
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,320
We need those that will accomplish

498
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,400
all God has laid before us.

499
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,720
We need a man, a woman, or someone...

500
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,520
Finally.

501
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,160
Amen, Pastor!

502
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,840
Because they're looking at you.

503
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,080
Because they're looking to the church.
Because they're looking to a better day.

504
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,800
Because they're looking to a new day.

505
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,720
Why? Because
it's time to rise up!

506
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,320
Rise up!

507
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,141
Somebody's gotta rise up this morning!

508
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,720
Rise up.

509
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,360
You buy all that stuff?

510
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,480
Yeah, I do.

511
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,200
Been taught it all my life.

512
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,942
I finally feel like I own it,
like it's mine.

513
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,680
What about you?

514
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,480
I'm Christian same as the next person,

515
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,240
but I believe rising up
means fighting back,

516
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,480
only way things are gonna change.

517
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,920
Tony, we in a system that
prevents any type of aspiration,

518
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,600
any type of growth.

519
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,800
Johnnie...

520
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,720
And then when one of us can't take it
anymore, we're made an example of.

521
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,040
We take the blame.

522
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,040
Hey, Johnnie!

523
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,600
Nuh-uh, but the blame
belongs in the system,

524
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,400
the system that's been keeping
us down time after time.

525
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,502
Johnnie Francis!

526
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,480
Go out with me.

527
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,720
What?

528
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,360
Friday night.

529
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,030
Okay, fine.

530
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,640
I'll pick you up?

531
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,280
Nuh-uh
I'll meet you there.

532
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,960
I'll pick you up.

533
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,120
I'll meet you there.

534
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,064
Rising up still means fighting back.

535
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,400
All right, let's bow our heads.

536
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,360
Dear God, thank you for this day.

537
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,160
Thank you for this chance
to play football

538
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,840
and fellowship together.

539
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,840
And we hope that we
honor you and your glory.

540
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,800
In Jesus' name, amen.

541
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,800
Let's go, man.
Come on.

542
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,743
First team O, first team D, let's go.

543
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,800
Well, he's paying attention.

544
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,986
He's paying attention now,
and that's the whole thing.

545
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,750
Excuse me.

546
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,711
Amen.

547
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,800
So, you're all in, huh?

548
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,400
Yep.

549
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,040
You are?

550
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,680
Yeah.

551
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,880
All right, then.

552
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,920
You know, we're meeting with the players
tonight over at Crestwood.

553
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,560
You should come.

554
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,640
If it was my neighborhood, maybe.

555
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,640
But Crestwood, come on,
you know it's only gonna be

556
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,280
white players there, Jerry.

557
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,031
I mean, what's that gonna achieve?

558
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,743
Shorty White, 2 o'clock.

559
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,120
Whoo!

560
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,200
I give you 30 seconds.

561
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,400
I'll give him less than that.

562
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,280
We're coming after you, Tandy.

563
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,520
Ooh, 8 more weeks 'til judgment day.

564
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,000
Glorious rivalry day.

565
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,160
Banks' Jets coming at you
from the clouds.

566
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,840
I'm bringing my white knight, son.

567
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,720
I know you know who he is,
Mr. Jeff Rutledge.

568
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,280
He's only the best
quarterback in the state, folks.

569
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,382
Birmingham News printed that.

570
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,000
I didn't say it.

571
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:40,360
Simple kind of man

572
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:47,025
Oh, be something you
love and understand

573
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:55,029
Baby, be a simple kind of man

574
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,662
Won't you do this for me, son...

575
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,782
Hey, Coach.

576
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,000
Good to see you.

577
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,000
Ain't never seen a house this big.

578
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,102
No, me neither.

579
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,280
You coming in?

580
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,560
You go ahead.

581
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,662
I'm just gonna have a quick smoke.

582
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,960
You really should.

583
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,427
It's pretty cool.

584
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:54,200
Well, Shorty White
beat 'em two seasons ago.

585
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,720
Golly, how many'd they dress, a hundred?

586
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,800
They got three times our budget
and a new stadium.

587
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,902
I don't see how that's fair.

588
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,720
We need to redefine winning.

589
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,360
Like a field goal, right?

590
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,720
I mean, no one's scored on 'em
this whole season,

591
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,080
and a field goal, bam, that's winning.

592
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:19,185
Jerry, is this real?

593
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,667
How does a whole team convert?

594
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,920
How is it that the only
place in the whole city

595
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,000
that blacks and whites get
along is my football team?

596
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,640
Why are you so cynical?

597
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:33,240
Because I believe in what I can see.

598
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:38,744
With all due respect, Coach,
you might start looking around.

599
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,680
Hey, we're gonna win this thing.

600
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,320
- Oh, here we go.
- Really?

601
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,920
We're gonna win this game,

602
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,920
and I've got something
I wanna say to the team.

603
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,640
Whoo!
Woodlawn!

604
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,390
Whoo!

605
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,905
Welcome back, everybody.

606
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,960
This is WXJC Birmingham,
and we're following

607
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,920
the number-one team in the state,

608
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:00,360
the Huffman Vikings,
on their so-far uncontested road

609
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,120
to another championship.

610
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,040
Now, tonight, they square off
against the Woodlawn Colonels,

611
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,880
and this should be a routine,
regular season ball game,

612
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,760
as they're favored by 6 touchdowns.

613
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,840
And on paper, folks, there's
no way at all that Woodlawn

614
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,910
has a chance against
this powerful ball club.

615
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,230
Okay boys, listen up.

616
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,320
The preacher wants to say a few words.

617
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,000
Thank you, Coach.

618
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,640
Make it good.

619
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,280
Yeah.

620
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,702
Read the highlighted, right there.

621
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,982
"This day..."

622
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:48,630
"This day the Lord
will deliver you into my hand

623
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,160
and I will strike you down."

624
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:55,680
So that all on earth know
that there is a God in Israel.

625
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,351
And David reached into his pocket,

626
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,349
and he pulled out a stone.

627
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:05,520
And he slung it, and it struck
the Philistine in the head.

628
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,760
And he fell.

629
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,000
You know what's gonna happen?

630
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,880
You're gonna win this game
tonight, you hear me?

631
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,520
Yes, sir!

632
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,160
You're gonna win this game!

633
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,560
You wanna know how I know
that you're gonna win this game?

634
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:22,000
Because it's not about you.

635
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:27,000
Nobody out there knows
what's happened with this team.

636
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:30,840
But when you win,
on this day, they will.

637
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,800
When you do what everyone
said is impossible, they will.

638
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:38,720
When you strike down
this giant, they will!

639
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,200
And when they find out how you did it,

640
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,920
then all the earth will know
that there is a God in Israel

641
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,560
on this day.

642
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,560
On this day!
On this day!

643
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,480
On this day!
On this day!

644
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,920
Hey, you're starting
at tailback tonight.

645
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,421
One, two, three, Woodlawn!

646
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,200
Nathan, come on.
We gotta go.

647
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,080
Yes, sir.

648
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:28,071
Let's just see what happens, okay?

649
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,270
Your momma's gonna kill me.

650
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,904
Turn, boys!

651
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,320
Receives deep at the 10-yard line.

652
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,200
Outstanding blocking as they
break open the double wedge,

653
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:50,100
just bowling over the much
smaller Woodlawn colonels.

654
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,870
Good job.
Good job.

655
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,520
Stack grip, cover two.

656
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,349
Get out of here, come on.

657
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,187
Stay in your lane!
Stay in your lane!

658
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,240
And touchdown.

659
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:21,120
Ackman is in the end zone,
taking only two plays.

660
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,200
And I have a feeling
this is just a portent

661
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,400
of what we're gonna be
seeing here this evening.

662
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,680
It could be a massacre
on the football field tonight.

663
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,800
They're big, Coach.

664
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,028
Really big.

665
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,184
Hey there, David.

666
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:51,560
What do you say you go in there
right now and take down that giant?

667
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,662
Make 'em all believe.

668
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,230
Break!

669
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:07,781
Woodlawn lines up
at their own 20 in the I formation.

670
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,746
Their tailback, number 22,
we've not seen him before.

671
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:15,023
His name is Tony Nathan.

672
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,224
Go Tony!

673
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:28,960
Nathan breaks the tackle.

674
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,040
Look at this guy go.

675
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,680
He's 40 past midfield.

676
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,360
One more man to beat.

677
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:36,440
There he goes to the 30, the 20, the 10.

678
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:40,240
And for the first time in over a year.

679
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:43,320
Touchdown Woodlawn.
An unbelievable run.

680
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:47,027
What a play by young Tony Nathan.

681
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,440
Hey, brother.

682
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,191
Jesus has a plan for your life.

683
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,040
Ackman Driving back with a vengeance.

684
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,280
They're deep in Woodlawn territory.

685
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,040
Murphy breaks left, picks up 5 yards.

686
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,360
It's a fumble!

687
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,720
Woodlawn has it.

688
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:17,480
An incredible hit by middle
linebacker, Mike Allyson.

689
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,360
Allyson, Allyson, come here!
Come here.

690
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,720
Good hit, son.
Great hit.

691
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,760
How many players are out there?
No, there's one.

692
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,440
Just one.
Number 45.

693
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,640
You take him out
and you clear a path for Nathan.

694
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,280
You take him out, we win this game.

695
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,030
Nathan, get in there.

696
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,400
Alright, so what are
you gonna do now, coach?

697
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,960
I'm just gonna give the ball to Tony.

698
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,920
And this is unbelievable.

699
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,960
The underdog Woodlawn Colonels

700
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:43,400
have the number-one team
in the state on their heels.

701
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:22,040
It is absolutely
pandemonium here tonight.

702
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,400
The number-one team
in the state is being

703
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,800
single-handedly dismantled by this young

704
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,902
junior tailback from Woodlawn.

705
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,920
We are witnessing a star being born.

706
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,560
Touchdown!

707
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,720
Touchdown, Tony Nathan.

708
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,280
And there it is.
It's all over.

709
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,120
It is all over.
Woodlawn has done it.

710
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,480
Woodlawn has done the impossible.

711
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:55,600
The biggest upset we have seen in years.

712
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,840
I can't believe it.
That is it.

713
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,466
The champ is down.

714
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:21,520
Great game.

715
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,520
Coach.

716
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,360
Coach, I don't know what
your players are playing with,

717
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,600
but I've never seen
a team play like that.

718
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,560
Good luck the rest of the season.

719
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,200
Let's go, son.

720
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,960
For God so loved the world
that he gave who?

721
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,560
His only begotten Son.

722
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:28,240
That whosoever believeth
in him should hot perish,

723
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,880
but what will they have?

724
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,505
Everlasting life.

725
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:35,420
God loved us, so he gave us Jesus.

726
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:40,262
If he gave you a gift,
why do you have it wrapped up?

727
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:44,880
Because the world needs the gift
that is trapped inside of you.

728
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,720
As a matter of fact, Tony, you stand up,

729
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:49,920
because you are using
your gift for God's glory.

730
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,720
Give Tony a round of applause.

731
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:57,520
We're proud of you, son,
for how you are letting God

732
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,480
shine through you every day.

733
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,120
Yeah.

734
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,745
Hallelujah.

735
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,181
Hallelujah.

736
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:10,240
Coach Gerelds, we welcome you

737
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,344
and your family here this morning.

738
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,720
Can I say a few words please, sir?

739
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,663
Come on, then.

740
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,944
I wanted to come here today because...

741
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:50,024
five of my players are here.

742
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:58,480
Five of my players
that have been mistreated

743
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,582
time and again by their school...

744
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,102
and by their teammates...

745
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:12,424
and I have not done enough to stop it.

746
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:20,080
Now, at the beginning
of this season, my team,

747
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:24,708
almost my entire team,
they gave themselves to love.

748
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,784
A love that I didn't understand.

749
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:37,225
A love that began to conquer hatred.

750
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,746
And after the game on Friday,
I went home...

751
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,262
and I prayed.

752
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,584
Not that I really know how to do that...

753
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,942
but I told God that,

754
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,502
"I don't know if you're real...

755
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:07,600
but I want whatever my players have."

756
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:21,520
And I came here today because I believe.

757
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,600
I believe, and I wanna be baptized.

758
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:46,343
Thank you, Jesus.

759
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,302
Amen.
I'll baptize you.

760
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:54,280
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

761
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,680
Buried with Christ in baptism,

762
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,909
raised to walk in the newness of life.

763
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:07,991
Knock, knock,
knocking on heaven's door

764
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:13,744
Knock, knock,
knocking on heaven's door

765
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:20,909
Knock, knock,
knocking on heaven's door

766
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:28,227
Knock, knock,
knocking on heaven's door

767
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,760
Hey buddy, can I speak to you
for a moment?

768
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,464
Sure.

769
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:46,383
Look, I know that this has been...

770
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,920
this has been a real tough year,
and it's been tough at school,

771
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,440
and I know we haven't spent
much time with each other.

772
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:55,040
That's okay.

773
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:57,240
No, it's not.

774
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:59,342
There's no excuse for it.

775
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,902
You mean a lot.

776
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,142
I love you, son.

777
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:14,280
You mean the world to me.

778
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:18,590
I think my biggest problem is that I...

779
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:21,544
I haven't had enough staff.

780
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:26,560
So, I was wondering if you
would be willing to help me

781
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:29,280
as an assistant coach.

782
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:32,384
I was thinking running backs, huh?

783
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,440
Calling out to everyone
across the nation

784
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:47,760
Nation, nation, nation

785
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:51,785
Said the world today
is in a desperate situation

786
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:52,787
Desperate situation

787
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,360
Move it! Move it!
Faster! Faster!

788
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,360
Stealing, burning, fighting, killing

789
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,160
Nothing but corruption

790
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:02,160
And it felt like he scored
every time he touched the ball.

791
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:05,160
Five touchdowns, three hundred yards.

792
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,760
He got a move, like Gail said.

793
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:10,480
Yeah, he got that...
he got that cut back speed.

794
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:16,720
We've got to learn
to live with each other

795
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:18,920
Twenty-two.
That's who he's like.

796
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,960
Twenty-two, yeah.

797
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,800
I'll tell you what, them recruiters
got to be calling, ain't they?

798
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:27,120
No, man, he's just a junior.
He's got another year left.

799
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:30,720
What the world needs now
is love and understanding

800
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:34,840
So get on board the friendship train

801
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:38,200
Everybody shake a hand

802
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,480
Now break it on down

803
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:43,160
Friendship train

804
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,000
Everybody shake a hand,
make a friend

805
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,640
Touchdown Tony Nathan.

806
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,280
Birmingham News, what's your secret?

807
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,920
I don't know.

808
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:52,480
How's it feel to have your
whole team on your shoulders?

809
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,105
Heavy.

810
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,800
He's something special, Mr. Nathan.

811
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:08,400
That boy is something special.
You hear me?

812
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,480
Good football player too.

813
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,702
I'm very proud.

814
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:25,909
Hey, Uncle Tom.

815
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:32,720
They gonna turn on you.

816
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:35,920
You see, we could use
a voice like yours,

817
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,280
so join us.

818
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:45,720
Okay, then, you stay away from her, huh?

819
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:48,080
I mean, she ain't your kind no more.

820
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:50,560
You wanna be one of these
cracker's trophy, that's fine.

821
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:54,062
So, why don't you just
stay with your own, huh?

822
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,240
How'd you find out where I live?

823
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,400
I asked.

824
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:13,920
Look, some people came
to talk to me from school.

825
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:19,743
Told me about some gangs,
some robberies.

826
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,640
About you.

827
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,560
Well, is it true?

828
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:27,440
I'm sorry, Tony.

829
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:31,520
Not everybody can be
as squeaky clean as you.

830
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,760
That's not you, Johnnie.
I know you.

831
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:36,480
You don't know anything about me.

832
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:38,240
What's going on?

833
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,600
Nothing, Daddy.

834
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:43,101
I was just telling him to leave.

835
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,580
Well, I guess you better be going, boy.

836
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,909
Go, get out of here.

837
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:05,520
Ladies and gentlemen, may
I have your attention please?

838
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:07,520
Thank you very much for being here.

839
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:10,960
This is the 11th Annual
Father-Son Banquet

840
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,800
for the Birmingham Quarterback Club.

841
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:21,920
Now, we are here to honor
the Birmingham player of the year.

842
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:24,705
Not since Pat Sullivan and Johnny Musso

843
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:29,760
has this award been given to
not one, but two individuals.

844
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,960
And those two tonight, Jeff Rutledge,

845
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:36,424
fine quarterback for Banks High School,
and Woodlawn's very own Tony Nathan.

846
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,440
Y'all boys come on up here
and get your awards.

847
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:43,320
Of course, these two teams are meeting
for the Birmingham City Championship,

848
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:46,424
and only one can advance
to the state playoffs.

849
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,680
Have a seat.

850
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,480
So now, ladies and gentlemen,
it is my distinct pleasure

851
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:59,040
to introduce our featured speaker tonight,
although he needs no introduction.

852
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:01,560
Please welcome our governor,
and if I had it my way,

853
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,840
the President
of these here United States,

854
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:06,000
George C. Wallace.

855
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,360
We'll have to take care of that.

856
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,920
Well, then, the governor
has just informed me

857
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:18,385
that he would like to have a picture
taken with these two young individuals.

858
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,106
So, Jeff, Nathan, come on up here.

859
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,000
Nathan, you hard of hearing?

860
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,640
Come on up.

861
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,280
We ain't got all night.

862
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:30,984
I'm sorry.
I can't.

863
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,680
What do you mean you can't? Huh?

864
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,320
You shy or something?

865
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,160
I can't

866
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:42,320
Well, of course you can.
The governor ain't gonna bite.

867
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:45,200
Just stand up, walk up to the governor,
and take a picture with him.

868
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,880
He said I couldn't go to Alabama,

869
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:51,320
not me or anybody like me.

870
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:55,280
Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.

871
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:59,180
So, I can't, sir.

872
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:07,466
Tandy, you get your
Negro up there right now.

873
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:11,840
I'll stand behind the wishes
of my player.

874
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,480
You sure about that?

875
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:16,231
Mm-hmm.

876
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:22,988
Take the picture.

877
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,880
Get on, come on!

878
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:33,143
Okay, second stop, the market.

879
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:16,880
You call the police?

880
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,400
No, I did not.

881
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,150
I'll call 'em.

882
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:25,026
You okay, champ?

883
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,108
The only way.

884
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,320
Welcome, everybody,
to Woodlawn High School.

885
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:00,640
One of the most heated rivalries
in the state of Alabama,

886
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:03,000
dating back over 4 decades.

887
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:06,080
It's no secret that the animosity exists

888
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,440
between Banks and Woodlawn.

889
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:10,907
You walk on this field,
you better walk off.

890
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:20,029
Gentlemen, shake hands.

891
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:22,222
Have a good, clean game.

892
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:24,943
I want you to punish them,
do you understand me?

893
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:25,947
Yes, sir!

894
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:26,960
What happens to compassionate people?

895
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:27,960
They lose!

896
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:31,560
They lose, that's right.
They lose. They lose!

897
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,200
It's been a Cinderella
season for Woodlawn,

898
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:37,160
but they have to win here tonight,
or that fairy tale is over.

899
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:40,264
Okay, come on, men.
Everyone take a knee.

900
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:45,909
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

901
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:48,720
Jesus can't save you now, fellas.

902
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:50,868
This is Jets football!

903
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:54,480
Jesus can't save you now!

904
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:56,184
You're going down!

905
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:59,024
Amen.

906
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,600
- Boys, you ready to beat Banks?
- Yes, sir!

907
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,800
- I said are you ready to beat Banks?
- Yes, sir!

908
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,550
One, two, three, believe!

909
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:26,200
A devastating hit on Tony Nathan,

910
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:30,440
and he is getting up slowly
at the 30-yard line.

911
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,110
Their gunnin' for him.

912
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,710
Hike!

913
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,427
I know, Jerry.
I know.

914
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,950
Come on, boy.

915
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:06,143
Nathan looks right,
then left, nowhere to go.

916
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:15,908
High left, 4-24 draw.

917
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:20,184
Hike!

918
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:35,990
He is short.

919
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,640
Down set.

920
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:01,390
Blue 18.

921
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:03,280
Blue 18.

922
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:04,984
Hike!

923
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:13,550
Excuse me, Coach.

924
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:17,040
Can't guard perfect, Coach.

925
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:19,000
Get 41.
Forty-one!

926
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,080
Down set!

927
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:23,069
Hike!

928
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:28,141
Middle, middle, middle!

929
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:31,505
Touchdown!

930
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:49,827
Get out there, boys.

931
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,960
You silence them, Nathan.

932
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:58,080
Nathan, you silence them.

933
01:05:58,180 --> 01:05:59,920
You get out there, and you shut them up.

934
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:02,261
Come on, get it done.
Come on!

935
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,160
That's just football, boys.
Little bit of rain.

936
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:08,960
Power C Waggle left on one.
On one.

937
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:11,108
Ready, break.

938
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:18,560
Hike!

939
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:34,549
Get up, son.

940
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:59,080
Hey, Danny!
You stop him right here.

941
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:00,830
You hear me?

942
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:12,351
You make 'em pay, son.
Right here!

943
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:26,360
He's still on his feet.

944
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,000
He's in the 20, the 15,

945
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,880
working his way through
the defense toward the end zone.

946
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,480
He's willing his way forward.
He scores.

947
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:37,266
Touchdown, Woodlawn.

948
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,948
Break it up!
Break it up!

949
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,480
Atta boy, atta boy, atta boy, atta boy.

950
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:13,280
Hey, that flag don't hurt me.

951
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,382
That flag don't hurt me.

952
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:27,800
Doc!

953
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,904
Coach, think we'll be taking
a big risk to let him play.

954
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:37,520
Nathan, we win with you.

955
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:40,280
We cannot win without you.
You understand?

956
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:41,905
Tony!

957
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:44,000
Adversity is a crucible of greatness.

958
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:49,160
Yes, sir.

959
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:50,360
Can you do this?

960
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:51,360
Yes, sir.

961
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:54,907
Okay, let's do it.
Come on.

962
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,030
Nathan!

963
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:08,708
Let's go.

964
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:14,320
Hey, Coach, has it rained harder?

965
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:16,104
Them angels is crying!

966
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:18,429
Them angels is crying!

967
01:09:56,260 --> 01:10:00,902
I just wanna say that
I am proud of all of you.

968
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:07,424
I'm proud of each and every one of you,

969
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:15,440
for the game that you played tonight

970
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:20,829
and the men that you
have become this season.

971
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:39,341
Hank, come on, just...
you say something.

972
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:22,200
Hey, hey, come here.
Come here, come here, come here.

973
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:24,600
Why didn't you play me?

974
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:28,680
You know what is more important
than winning football games?

975
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:30,430
You are.

976
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:33,669
You are.

977
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:36,747
You are.

978
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:51,000
Jesus says to love our enemies.

979
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:55,310
We have to love those that oppose us.

980
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:59,800
We have to love those
that are against us,

981
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:04,320
to do good to those that persecute us.

982
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:10,760
This is the kind of love that
isn't easy, but if we do it,

983
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:13,320
we will see change like
we have never seen before.

984
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:15,200
Because here's the question.

985
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:19,703
If you only love those
that love you back,

986
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:23,680
what kind of love is that?

987
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:26,120
Amen!

988
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:28,600
Think about it, church.

989
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:30,429
Think about it.

990
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,920
I can do pork chops.

991
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,560
I'm gonna fry 'em up in some flour.

992
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:36,867
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

993
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:52,462
What in the world?

994
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:55,386
That's Bear Bryant.

995
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,280
Hello, son.

996
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:01,920
I'm Coach Bryant.

997
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:03,624
I know.

998
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:06,902
Junior, get the baby.

999
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:18,560
Did you always wanna be a coach?

1000
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:20,600
My mama wanted me to be a preacher,

1001
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:23,280
but I told her that
coaching and preaching

1002
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:24,880
is pretty much the same thing.

1003
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:29,080
We both serve something
greater than ourselves.

1004
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:32,520
She went for it.

1005
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:34,622
Oh, I could eat that whole thing.

1006
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:40,400
You know, a great team
shares the same heartbeat.

1007
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,040
That's what I believe.

1008
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:44,440
Amen.

1009
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:49,160
If there is one thing
that has helped me as a coach,

1010
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:53,160
Louise, it's my ability
to recognize winners,

1011
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:54,800
or good people who can become winners.

1012
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:58,160
And that's what I see
when I look at you, Tony.

1013
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:00,000
And I'm talking about
winning in the larger sense.

1014
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:03,229
I'm talking about character.

1015
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:06,105
Now, you have a strong family.

1016
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:08,600
That's a great advantage.

1017
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:11,840
And you're coached by a special coach.

1018
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:14,160
Thank you, sir.

1019
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:15,910
So, you coming'?

1020
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:19,400
Where?

1021
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,680
'Bama.

1022
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:24,440
My coach, he played at Auburn.

1023
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:25,701
Son...

1024
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,240
don't you want one of these?

1025
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:32,880
Sure do.

1026
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:35,600
Louise, he ain't gonna
get one at Auburn.

1027
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:39,080
I feel sorry for those boys.

1028
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:44,600
How many black players you got?

1029
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:49,280
Well, we got Wilber Jackson,
and he's a stud.

1030
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:52,800
But I don't have white players
and black players.

1031
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:54,600
I have football players.

1032
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:58,120
That's how I see it.

1033
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:03,784
But in answer to your question,
not nearly enough.

1034
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:06,904
So, why do you see that changing?

1035
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:10,182
Because it's time.

1036
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:15,588
Are you gonna help me?

1037
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:39,704
Football just hurts me
and everybody around me.

1038
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,080
Nobody's forcing you to play football.

1039
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:48,706
You know that, right?

1040
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:54,800
You can walk away right now
and let the world pass on by.

1041
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:57,760
But this is bigger
than football, ain't it?

1042
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:59,510
Yes, sir.

1043
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:06,268
Some kinda great power
been given to you, son.

1044
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:08,640
I can see it in them kids' faces.

1045
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:11,280
I know what they're thinking.

1046
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:14,640
"A black star like you
at a white high school?

1047
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:19,280
If he can do it, so can I."

1048
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:22,080
That is your gift.

1049
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:26,640
This is your time to do as you choose.

1050
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:30,600
And that's a lot to carry.

1051
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:33,749
So tell me what to do, and I'll do it.

1052
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,600
The Good Book says

1053
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:45,560
"When there is no vision,
the people perish."

1054
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:49,000
That means people
can't live without hope.

1055
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:53,000
They need it like they need air.

1056
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,750
I say...

1057
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:57,302
go give it to 'em.

1058
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:04,560
Tony.

1059
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:06,360
You all know Tony Nathan.

1060
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:08,480
He set this up.

1061
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:10,120
Thanks Jeff.

1062
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:12,400
This is Hank.
He's got something to say.

1063
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:16,200
Thank you very much, Mr. Rutledge.

1064
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:20,240
We found something at Woodlawn.

1065
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:21,920
Something that's bigger than winning.

1066
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:24,880
It's bigger than football.

1067
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:26,640
It's why we're here.

1068
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:30,480
It's bigger than this rivalry.

1069
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:32,080
We wanna share it with you.

1070
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:37,505
We wanna schedule a meeting with
your entire team and your coach.

1071
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:45,280
You think this school'll understand

1072
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:46,920
what we're doing here?

1073
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:50,024
They won't understand, and that's okay.

1074
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,102
Boys.

1075
01:17:57,860 --> 01:17:59,510
Coach!

1076
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:02,620
Shorty, Hank, what's this all about?

1077
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:10,000
We finally had our first meeting,
that tent revival thing.

1078
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,080
Jeff set it up over at the church.

1079
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:14,400
I went to shut it down anyway,

1080
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,880
'cause I thought Jesus
would make my boys weak.

1081
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:20,160
Next thing you know,
I'm the first one walking down the aisle,

1082
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:24,640
crying like a child,
my whole team behind me.

1083
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:26,440
My whole team.

1084
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:28,080
How does that happen?

1085
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:29,680
You gotta see it with your own eyes.

1086
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:32,040
Unbelievable.

1087
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:34,142
I'm a changed man...

1088
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:37,680
and I'm sorry.

1089
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:38,960
Fine.

1090
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:40,160
I will take it.

1091
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:42,080
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

1092
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:43,720
I'm glad that's over.

1093
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:47,427
We are gonna do camp
a little different this year.

1094
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:50,800
Yeah, just a little bit different.

1095
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:56,191
You wanna do something wild,
something truly rebellious?

1096
01:18:56,300 --> 01:19:00,000
I like that.

1097
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:02,560
I want you to do something
that's never been done before.

1098
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:04,344
At least, not to my knowledge.

1099
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:24,840
Prepare yourself,
you know it's a must

1100
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:28,720
Gotta have a friend in Jesus

1101
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:30,345
So you know that...

1102
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:33,760
Wouldn't be very Christian if you stole
my playbook now, Tandy, would it?

1103
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:35,440
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

1104
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:37,463
No, it would not.

1105
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:44,160
You know, I've always wanted
two things professionally:

1106
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:48,560
to win a championship,
and to coach a truly great player.

1107
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:51,664
You've done both, so which is better?

1108
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:56,640
Rings collect dust.

1109
01:19:56,740 --> 01:20:00,586
That right there, that lasts forever.

1110
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:07,464
Two rivals, Banks and Woodlawn,
had their fall camp together.

1111
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:10,000
Both credit a spiritual
experience as the cause

1112
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,200
for the public show of unity.

1113
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:15,440
The trouble is they can't
both enter the playoffs

1114
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:17,360
because they're in the same district.

1115
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:20,600
Many say this rule
is unfortunate, unfair,

1116
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:22,240
and should change.

1117
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:29,942
Mom, I got it.

1118
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:34,240
Hello, son.

1119
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:37,880
I'm not leaving here until
you decide to come to Alabama.

1120
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:39,823
Excuse me.

1121
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,309
Momma!

1122
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:48,200
Dear Lord, we thank you for this food

1123
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,040
and for your provisions.

1124
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:53,600
Strengthen us with it
so that we might serve you.

1125
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:56,200
Amen.

1126
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:59,960
And may I add, God in heaven,
help Tony see the light, Amen.

1127
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:03,400
I do love corn.

1128
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,000
Not me!

1129
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:06,989
You don't like nothing!

1130
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:39,064
Tony.

1131
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:54,480
We all do what we do in life.

1132
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:56,582
Go our different ways.

1133
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:04,120
The idea of molding men,

1134
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:08,680
well, that means a lot to me.

1135
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:11,960
And I want you to know
that I'm here to help

1136
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,040
no matter what choice you make.

1137
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:19,040
And I think you can feel that.

1138
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:22,144
Now, your momma...

1139
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:27,720
“showed me this.

1140
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:30,880
Said it was taped to a brick
thrown into this house.

1141
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:32,982
At my little brother.

1142
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:40,920
He didn't do nothing.

1143
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:44,183
That was all because of me.

1144
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:53,040
Tony, when I was coming up here,

1145
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:59,520
I passed a football field full of kids.

1146
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:05,468
I saw a young black boy wearin'
number 22, his head held high.

1147
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:09,022
That's also because of you.

1148
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:15,429
And I wanna say something, son.

1149
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:22,903
You know the difference
between you and these people?

1150
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:29,989
They're cowards, and you ain't.

1151
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:50,760
Here comes the senior tailback

1152
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:52,480
in his ﬁrst game of the year.

1153
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:54,640
Of course, expectations are high.

1154
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:57,903
Dozens of college scouts
and coaches are here watching.

1155
01:23:58,020 --> 01:24:00,480
And, folks, the atmosphere is electric.

1156
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:04,665
They all want to see
what this kid can do.

1157
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:12,840
Do you feel unstoppable when you run?

1158
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:14,440
No, I just wanna give Jesus Christ

1159
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:16,304
all the glory for giving us
another victory.

1160
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:27,920
What do you think about Jeff Rutledge?

1161
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:29,590
Best QB in the state.

1162
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:38,720
Fifteen second leeway, Alabama
with one time out remaining

1163
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:40,360
Rutledge on a roll.

1164
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:43,464
Looks down the middle, and it is...

1165
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:46,022
Caught!
Touchdown!

1166
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:49,360
So, Jeff, what do you think
of Touchdown Tony?

1167
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:52,625
I think Tony Nathan's the best
running back in the country.

1168
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:03,385
You've got a big game next week.

1169
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,840
What do you say to those calling
it Nathan vs. Rutledge?

1170
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:08,960
Just two great teams.
Gonna be a great game.

1171
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:09,960
Good luck, Tony.

1172
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:11,760
Thank you.

1173
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:13,800
Hey, what paper'd you say you're with?

1174
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:15,948
"Sports Illustrated."

1175
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:20,800
The question, what happens
when an unstoppable force

1176
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:22,680
meets an immoveable object?

1177
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:24,600
We're gonna ﬁnd out on Friday.

1178
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:27,120
This is the game
we've all been waiting for.

1179
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:31,400
The top two teams in the state
facing off in a clash of titans.

1180
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,040
Both are undefeated.

1181
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:36,680
Both have one of the most highly
ranked athletes in the nation.

1182
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:38,800
And because of the expected crowds,

1183
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:40,400
the game has been moved to the heart

1184
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,920
of Birmingham: Legion Field.

1185
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:45,102
It's Nathan vs. Rutledge.

1186
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:50,742
Get those knees up.

1187
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:57,440
You spying out the battlefield
like me, huh?

1188
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:59,760
How many people you think?

1189
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:01,560
I don't know.

1190
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:04,664
Heard it could be close to 20,000.

1191
01:26:06,180 --> 01:26:08,960
Ain't never seen that
many people in my life.

1192
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:11,400
You see the "Sports Illustrated"?

1193
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,040
Nah, man.

1194
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:17,240
"Faces in the Crowd," you're in there.

1195
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:19,960
I'm sure the Bear came and saw
you, gave you the ring speech.

1196
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:21,600
Yeah.

1197
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:24,360
"You ain't gonna get one over there."

1198
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:26,383
Yeah, he did.

1199
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:28,000
You decided?

1200
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:30,600
Man, I don't even know.

1201
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:34,280
I've never made this big
of a decision before in my life.

1202
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:35,984
Me too.

1203
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:40,560
Well, go where you feel like you
can make the most difference.

1204
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:43,640
That's what I'm gonna do.

1205
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:48,520
It's crazy, all these
people coming to see us.

1206
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:52,240
What's so special about us?

1207
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:54,600
We're a symbol.

1208
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:56,623
We give them hope.

1209
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:23,989
I ain't seen you in school.

1210
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:26,280
I got suspended.

1211
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:28,320
Why?

1212
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:30,760
Because I wanted to.

1213
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:34,240
Ain't nobody gonna
bus me to that prison.

1214
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:40,400
That's the only way
I saw out, that's all.

1215
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:43,743
Who's been doing this to you?

1216
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:49,920
You need to leave.

1217
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:51,960
Right now, please.

1218
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:54,381
Go.

1219
01:27:57,620 --> 01:28:00,800
Touchdown Tony Nathan.

1220
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:04,520
What you doing here,
digging in the trash?

1221
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:09,560
Tony!

1222
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:16,225
That might be your daughter,
but that's the woman I love.

1223
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:50,680
Did you actually read through this?

1224
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:52,440
Come on.

1225
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:55,920
Parents are calling it
abrasive and overreaching.

1226
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:57,520
I didn't force anyone to do anything.

1227
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:59,160
You know what this is.

1228
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:00,800
It's retribution.

1229
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:05,000
Yes, I know, but I am
compelled to deal with it.

1230
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:08,560
Look at the changes to these boys, Owen.

1231
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:10,160
It is amazing to see.

1232
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:12,040
It is.

1233
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:15,064
But this is a public high school.

1234
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:48,302
Mr. Whitehurst.

1235
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:50,640
And you are?

1236
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:54,080
I'm Linda, sir.
I'm a teacher.

1237
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:56,280
And what is this?

1238
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:58,360
It's a prayer meeting.

1239
01:29:58,460 --> 01:29:59,960
Prayer meeting?

1240
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:01,800
The kids started it themselves Friday night

1241
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:04,280
and it just hasn't stopped.

1242
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:07,600
God, thank you for the change
that you've brought upon this city.

1243
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:09,800
Thank you for the change that
you've brought upon this school.

1244
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:12,360
Thank you for the change that
you have brought upon my life.

1245
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:14,640
Are you leading this?

1246
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:16,868
No, sir.
I was an atheist last week.

1247
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:21,702
The kids, they're leading me.

1248
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:25,080
It's spreading all over the school.

1249
01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:27,320
There's even a rally
tonight at Legion Field

1250
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:30,662
if you want to come.
Coach is setting it up.

1251
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:53,320
I just wanna thank Coach Gerelds
and his team for putting this together.

1252
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:57,120
Thank you, Coach.

1253
01:30:57,220 --> 01:30:59,240
Would you look at this?

1254
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:01,320
I mean, take a look around.

1255
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:03,520
Can you believe it?

1256
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:07,200
This is what happens when God shows up.

1257
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:13,600
Now, a couple years back,
I went to this thing called

1258
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:17,560
"The Explo '72" in Dallas.

1259
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:22,302
I joined a hundred thousand
other people just like us.

1260
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:24,920
Up until that point in my life,

1261
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:29,060
I guess I kinda felt insignificant.

1262
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:33,600
I felt like my life doesn't matter.

1263
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:36,200
Then the last night of the week,

1264
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:41,306
there in the big Cotton Bowl,
they shut off the lights.

1265
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:48,880
And in that darkness,
Reverend Graham lit a candle.

1266
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:51,440
A single candle.

1267
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:56,120
I was standing in the very
back of the stadium,

1268
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:59,429
but I could see that light.

1269
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:06,503
And I realized that my
life is not insigniﬁcant.

1270
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:12,305
My life matters.

1271
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:18,560
One light became two and two became ten

1272
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:23,280
and ten became a hundred thousand.

1273
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:25,640
Well, people in Dallas started
calling the ﬁre department

1274
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:27,280
and the police department,

1275
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:30,560
saying,
"The Cotton Bowl's on fire!"

1276
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:32,708
Well, you know what?

1277
01:32:33,740 --> 01:32:35,742
They were right.

1278
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:41,040
A hundred thousand candles
burning as one.

1279
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:44,440
"Time Magazine" said
that the Jesus revolution...

1280
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:49,626
that's what they called us...
has a symbol.

1281
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:56,280
This is our symbol.

1282
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:58,880
Because there is one way.

1283
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:04,400
We're not gathered here united tonight

1284
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:09,960
because of the name
of our teams or of our schools,

1285
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:13,064
but because of the name above all names:

1286
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:16,120
Jesus.

1287
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:23,320
Jesus.

1288
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:27,800
One person alone in the dark,

1289
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:34,040
willing to speak the truth
when it's not popular,

1290
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:39,840
one person willing to speak
the truth when it is not safe,

1291
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:42,944
when there is much at stake.

1292
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:49,360
Look around you.

1293
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:53,240
We're not alone.

1294
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:58,710
This is what happens when God shows up.

1295
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:11,720
Well, here he comes.

1296
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:14,240
Coach, so glad you could join us.

1297
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:16,520
I believe you know everybody here.

1298
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:19,840
This is Brenda Halley,
lawyer from Montgomery.

1299
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:21,021
Ma'am.

1300
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:23,240
Why don't you take your seat
and let us get started.

1301
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:24,840
Go right ahead.

1302
01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:30,480
Did you have an evangelist of some sort
speak to the team this year and last?

1303
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:32,480
Yes.

1304
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:34,120
Was this activity school sponsored?

1305
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:36,080
Was it required?

1306
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:38,440
Well, it just sorta happened.

1307
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:41,120
It wasn't required, at least
not the way that I saw.

1308
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:44,000
Last year, did you recite
the Lord's Prayer

1309
01:34:44,100 --> 01:34:47,880
before and after each game?

1310
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:49,520
Yes, we did.

1311
01:34:49,620 --> 01:34:52,560
Did you dismiss players because
they didn't wanna be a part of this?

1312
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:53,560
Yes, he did.

1313
01:34:53,660 --> 01:34:55,640
That is in outright lie.
Your son quit.

1314
01:34:55,740 --> 01:34:58,400
Coach, are you aware of the U.S.
Supreme Court ruling on this issue?

1315
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,070
Because you're in clear violation of it.

1316
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:02,320
And whether you like it or not,
you are breaking the law.

1317
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:05,941
See, I think this has more to do
with the color of my tailback than God.

1318
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:08,040
I want you to stop
all religious activities

1319
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:10,825
until this board has taken this
matter under full review.

1320
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:12,200
You mean on school property?

1321
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:17,120
I mean all activities, otherwise
you will be removed as coach

1322
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:19,160
from Woodlawn High School.

1323
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:21,320
Which may already
be the case after this matter

1324
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:23,422
has been fully reviewed by the board.

1325
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:30,468
Can I come in?

1326
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:37,191
You know, I had my ﬁrst coaching job

1327
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:39,302
when I was 22 years old.

1328
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:46,720
This is the only job
that I have ever had.

1329
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:49,585
It's all I know how to do.

1330
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:55,750
What can I do for you?

1331
01:35:55,860 --> 01:35:57,400
That's what I wanted to ask you.

1332
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:59,800
How do you mean?

1333
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:01,960
I don't like it when
my teammates get hit.

1334
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:04,080
Same goes for my coach.

1335
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:05,720
Thank you, Tony.

1336
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:09,600
I think I'm gonna get hit
no matter what I do.

1337
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:12,704
I got some tough decisions to make.

1338
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:18,504
You once told me
that winning solves everything.

1339
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:22,105
I don't know if I believe that anymore.

1340
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:24,160
They do.

1341
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:26,080
So, let me help you carry this.

1342
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:27,989
How are you gonna do that?

1343
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:30,102
By winning you a championship.

1344
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:35,584
All right.

1345
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:39,469
All right.
Let's go beat Banks.

1346
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:45,507
Do-do-do-do do do do do

1347
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:49,080
Do-do-do-do do do do do

1348
01:36:49,180 --> 01:36:52,720
Do-do-do-do do do do do

1349
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:55,824
Do-do-do-do do do

1350
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:08,680
Jesus is just alright with me

1351
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:12,240
Jesus is just alright, oh, yeah

1352
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:15,720
Jesus is just alright with me

1353
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:21,280
Jesus is just alright

1354
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:24,520
I don't care what they may say

1355
01:37:24,620 --> 01:37:28,080
I don't care what they may do

1356
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:31,560
I don't care what they may say

1357
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:35,000
Jesus is just alright, oh, yeah

1358
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:38,627
Jesus is just alright

1359
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:46,280
You hear that, boys?

1360
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:48,360
That's for you.

1361
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:50,480
Use it.

1362
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:53,160
Use that sound.

1363
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:55,080
We need another half-hour coach.

1364
01:37:55,180 --> 01:37:56,680
Another half-hour?

1365
01:37:56,780 --> 01:37:58,000
We're getting 'em in as quick as we can.

1366
01:37:58,100 --> 01:37:59,400
How many people are out there?

1367
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:01,502
A lot.

1368
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:09,662
Coach.

1369
01:38:09,940 --> 01:38:12,420
Can I have a moment with my son?

1370
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:27,560
There's a lot of people out there, Dad.

1371
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:29,520
I know.

1372
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:33,200
But they ain't here
to see Woodlawn vs. Banks.

1373
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:36,304
They're here to see you.

1374
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:46,622
You've given a lot of people
hope, and I'm proud of you.

1375
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:51,102
Look at me.

1376
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:56,142
I'm proud of you.

1377
01:38:59,660 --> 01:39:04,951
Win or lose, you're my son.

1378
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:19,600
How do you feel?

1379
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:21,120
Nervous.

1380
01:39:21,220 --> 01:39:22,160
Don't be.

1381
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:23,785
How many people are out there?

1382
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:25,902
Tony, come on.

1383
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:29,102
You'll see.

1384
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:35,600
We're gonna do this one way.

1385
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:37,240
All right, let's do this, come on.

1386
01:39:44,620 --> 01:39:48,545
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

1387
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:52,600
All right, here we go.
Here we go.

1388
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:58,280
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

1389
01:39:58,380 --> 01:40:00,860
Tony! Tony! Tony!

1390
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:05,066
One way, boys!
Let's do this!

1391
01:40:11,260 --> 01:40:14,040
Welcome to Legion Field
in Birmingham, Alabama,

1392
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:16,680
where history is being made
here tonight.

1393
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:20,000
Never before and perhaps
never again have there been

1394
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:23,640
so many people to see
a high school football game.

1395
01:40:23,740 --> 01:40:26,120
And they're not here
just to see two teams.

1396
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:28,520
They are here to see players,

1397
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:30,720
and one just entered the stadium.

1398
01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:33,720
Number 22, Touchdown Tony.

1399
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:35,840
And you can hear the cheers
for this young man.

1400
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:38,120
They are deafening.

1401
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:49,920
And the Banks Jets have just landed.

1402
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:53,680
Here they come, led by senior
superstar quarterback,

1403
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:55,400
Jeff Rutledge.

1404
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:58,600
Legion Field is all
but full to capacity.

1405
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:01,000
There is a line of cars still outside,

1406
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:03,440
stretching as far as the eye can see,

1407
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:05,840
and this crowd is continuing to build.

1408
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:09,800
As a matter of fact, I've
already seen seven SEC coaches

1409
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:13,240
in attendance here today.

1410
01:41:13,340 --> 01:41:15,720
Auburn.

1411
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:18,187
They'll let anybody in.

1412
01:41:19,420 --> 01:41:26,320
O'er the land of the free

1413
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:33,429
And the home of the brave I

1414
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:45,160
Let's go, Hank.

1415
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:46,960
Where we going?

1416
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:49,666
To do something wild and rebellious.

1417
01:41:52,220 --> 01:41:55,064
Shorty!

1418
01:41:57,220 --> 01:41:59,320
Pray for us, Hank.

1419
01:41:59,420 --> 01:42:00,945
Really?

1420
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:03,381
Pray for us.

1421
01:42:05,260 --> 01:42:07,120
What are we doing?

1422
01:42:07,220 --> 01:42:10,520
Giving credit where credit is due.

1423
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:12,622
Let's pray.

1424
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:23,600
Will you pray with me?

1425
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:29,880
Our Father who art in heaven,

1426
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:32,120
hallowed be thy name.

1427
01:42:32,220 --> 01:42:34,480
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done...

1428
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:44,560
Give us this day our daily bread.

1429
01:42:44,660 --> 01:42:46,440
And forgive us our trespasses,

1430
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:50,000
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1431
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:54,240
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

1432
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:58,240
For thine is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory.

1433
01:42:58,340 --> 01:42:59,880
For ever and ever.

1434
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:01,680
Amen.

1435
01:43:01,780 --> 01:43:03,360
One way!

1436
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:05,640
Amen.

1437
01:43:05,740 --> 01:43:06,866
Good luck, Coach.

1438
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:11,783
Amen.

1439
01:43:22,820 --> 01:43:25,400
Take a look around, y'all.
Take this all in.

1440
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:27,160
This is something special.

1441
01:43:27,260 --> 01:43:28,680
Let's go do what we do, all right?

1442
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:30,280
Spider 2-Y Banana on one.

1443
01:43:30,380 --> 01:43:32,030
Spider 2-Y Banana on one, ready?

1444
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:44,670
Hike!

1445
01:44:25,060 --> 01:44:27,108
Pass! Pass!

1446
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:30,423
There you go!

1447
01:44:40,420 --> 01:44:42,560
You all right?
Good hit.

1448
01:44:42,660 --> 01:44:44,280
You gotta release the ball quicker.

1449
01:44:44,380 --> 01:44:45,984
You're holding onto it too much.

1450
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:48,120
Go, go, go, go, go.

1451
01:44:48,220 --> 01:44:49,745
You got this.

1452
01:44:55,540 --> 01:44:57,560
Both teams are at a standstill,

1453
01:44:57,660 --> 01:45:00,664
neither one able to break through.

1454
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:04,880
Rutledge drops back to pass.

1455
01:45:04,980 --> 01:45:06,505
Looks right, lets it fly.

1456
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:09,829
A perfect spiral, a beautiful throw...

1457
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:15,160
And is caught!

1458
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:18,080
Finds its target at the ten-yard line,

1459
01:45:18,180 --> 01:45:19,720
into the end zone.

1460
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:22,640
Banks is first on the board.
Touchdown!

1461
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:25,240
The master of offense, Shorty White,

1462
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:28,120
has willed his team through
and into the end zone.

1463
01:45:28,220 --> 01:45:29,720
That's okay.
Let's get it back.

1464
01:45:29,820 --> 01:45:32,080
Let's get it back.
Don't turn over the ball.

1465
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:34,120
Positive yardage, okay?
We can break one.

1466
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:35,824
You can break one in.

1467
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:38,440
Halftime, and the score
remains the same.

1468
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:44,280
Banks has been the only team to
find the end zone here tonight.

1469
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:46,920
Coach, I know what you're thinking,
but we gotta do something.

1470
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:48,670
This ain't working.

1471
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:51,960
Hey, time out.

1472
01:45:57,140 --> 01:46:00,960
Boys, just take a breath, okay?

1473
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:02,600
Just breathe.

1474
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:05,400
Look around you.
Savor this moment.

1475
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:09,680
Okay, Mum, I Right 25 Blast, okay?

1476
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:11,942
Let's go do it.

1477
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:13,664
Nathan...

1478
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:21,240
What do you feel but you can't say, huh?

1479
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:25,390
What do you want to say
to all of these people?

1480
01:46:28,900 --> 01:46:30,640
You say it when you run, Tony.

1481
01:46:30,740 --> 01:46:32,720
You say it when you run.

1482
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:35,280
Now, this is your moment.
This is your time.

1483
01:46:35,380 --> 01:46:36,920
Yes, sir.

1484
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:38,600
So, you go and take it.
You go and take it!

1485
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:40,304
Yes, sir!

1486
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:04,840
Hike!

1487
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:08,960
It's to Nathan.

1488
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:10,360
Nothing doing on the right side.

1489
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:12,040
He'll change direction.
Shakes off the tackle.

1490
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:13,680
Finds a hole.

1491
01:47:13,780 --> 01:47:17,387
And he's brought down
after a gain of five.

1492
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:32,061
He's still up!

1493
01:47:32,180 --> 01:47:34,280
He's still on his feet!
He breaks another tackle.

1494
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:36,240
He's moving up the head of steam.

1495
01:47:36,340 --> 01:47:37,560
He's past midﬁeld.

1496
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:41,346
He leaps over the linebacker
like Superman.

1497
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:48,667
Heading to the far corner,
he's got one man to beat.

1498
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:50,280
There he goes.

1499
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:52,382
He's gone!

1500
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:08,720
Touchdown, Woodlawn!

1501
01:48:08,820 --> 01:48:11,920
Touchdown, Tony Nathan!

1502
01:48:12,020 --> 01:48:14,600
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

1503
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:18,800
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

1504
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:04,544
It was amazing.

1505
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:08,080
You could feel it in
the stadium all over.

1506
01:49:08,180 --> 01:49:10,920
Forty-two thousand fans at
a high school football game.

1507
01:49:11,020 --> 01:49:12,520
Not even the play-offs.

1508
01:49:12,620 --> 01:49:16,800
I mean, none of the tickets
were pre-purchased.

1509
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:19,560
They had to send home 20,000 people.

1510
01:49:19,660 --> 01:49:21,160
You know,
a "National Geographic" reporter

1511
01:49:21,260 --> 01:49:22,800
who was coming through
even wrote about it

1512
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:28,520
and he said it was undeniably spiritual.

1513
01:49:28,620 --> 01:49:30,622
Supernatural even.

1514
01:49:36,220 --> 01:49:38,222
It was life-changing for me.

1515
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:43,782
It was unbelievable.

1516
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:47,702
So?

1517
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:49,560
So, what?

1518
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:51,200
Did you win?

1519
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:57,142
No, we did not.

1520
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:03,000
Look, I'll have these policies ready
for you first thing in the morning.

1521
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:05,800
So, what's the answer?

1522
01:50:05,900 --> 01:50:07,902
Do you believe in miracles?

1523
01:50:09,860 --> 01:50:11,862
Yes, I do.

1524
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:14,902
I am one.

1525
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:20,622
Well, thanks for the story.

1526
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:15,520
Hi! Honey!

1527
01:51:15,620 --> 01:51:17,200
Where in the world have you been?

1528
01:51:17,300 --> 01:51:20,760
You are late, mister.
The game's already started.

1529
01:51:20,860 --> 01:51:24,200
I just wanted to walk.
It's such a beautiful day.

1530
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:28,040
All right, well, there you go, honey.

1531
01:51:28,140 --> 01:51:30,800
Just not today.

1532
01:51:30,900 --> 01:51:32,902
Okay.

1533
01:51:35,580 --> 01:51:38,720
Penn State and Alabama in the Super Dome

1534
01:51:38,820 --> 01:51:42,400
in New Orleans
in this ABC Sports exclusive.

1535
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:43,400
Alabama...

1536
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:44,800
There he is.

1537
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:48,080
Ah, there he is!
There's Tony, Todd!

1538
01:51:48,180 --> 01:51:50,080
They call him Touchdown Tony Nathan.

1539
01:51:50,180 --> 01:51:52,280
He's home-grown, right in Birmingham,

1540
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:54,701
and he can break the long run
almost anywhere at any time.

1541
01:51:54,820 --> 01:51:56,424
Tony Nathan.

1542
01:51:56,540 --> 01:52:00,280
Here comes Alabama.

1543
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:04,280
Here is the offensive back field
for the Crimson Tide of Alabama.

1544
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:07,160
The quarterback, Major Ogilvie,
is the other halfback,

1545
01:52:07,260 --> 01:52:09,422
and Steve Whitman is the full back.

1546
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:11,542
Allyson!

1547
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:14,040
Did I miss anything?

1548
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:17,383
Oftentimes he's the money man
in this call.

1549
01:52:59,460 --> 01:53:01,462
Now that is Alabama football.

1550
01:53:02,460 --> 01:53:04,360
That was the last play of the ball game.

1551
01:53:04,460 --> 01:53:05,760
It is over.

1552
01:53:05,860 --> 01:53:10,866
Alabama has defeated Penn State
by a score of 14 to 7.

1553
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:15,400
Alabama has won six times
in the Sugar Bowl.

1554
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:17,343
The Bear goes for a ride.

1555
01:53:45,100 --> 01:53:46,880
Hello?

1556
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:52,146
Hey Coach, I told you
I'd win you a championship.

1557
01:53:54,780 --> 01:53:56,320
Tony.

1558
01:53:56,420 --> 01:53:57,960
Did you see it?

1559
01:53:58,060 --> 01:53:59,800
I would not have
missed it for the world.

1560
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:01,400
I am so proud of you.

1561
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:04,400
- All right, Tony!
- Tony, you won us a big one.

1562
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:11,720
I don't have much time,
but I wanted to tell you something.

1563
01:54:11,820 --> 01:54:14,160
I'm gonna ask Johnnie
to marry me after graduation.

1564
01:54:14,260 --> 01:54:18,400
That's just great, Tony.
Congratulations.

1565
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:21,080
How's the team this year?

1566
01:54:21,180 --> 01:54:23,400
I'm not coaching anymore.

1567
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:25,000
I needed some time away from it.

1568
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:27,400
I'm selling insurance right
across the street from Woodlawn.

1569
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:31,027
Just gives me some
more time with my family.

1570
01:54:31,140 --> 01:54:36,720
All right, I respect that.

1571
01:54:36,820 --> 01:54:40,560
They're calling for me, I gotta go.

1572
01:54:40,660 --> 01:54:45,840
I love you, Coach.

1573
01:54:45,940 --> 01:54:51,120
I love you, too, son.

1574
01:54:51,220 --> 01:54:54,920
I don't know what kind
of insurance salesman you are,

1575
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:58,160
but you were born to be a coach.

1576
01:54:58,260 --> 01:55:00,920
One of the best I've ever had.

1577
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:04,320
Someone once told me
we all have a purpose.

1578
01:55:04,420 --> 01:55:09,108
Maybe it's time to start
living yours again.

1579
01:55:09,220 --> 01:55:10,904
Gotta go.

1580
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:04,222
Look around you.

1581
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:08,462
We're not alone.

1582
01:56:10,300 --> 01:56:15,101
This is what happens when God shows up.

1583
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:27,520
We are one in the Spirit

1584
01:56:27,620 --> 01:56:30,520
We are one in the Lord

1585
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:33,320
We are one in the Spirit

1586
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:36,400
We are one in the Lord

1587
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:42,985
And we pray that all unity
may one day be restored

1588
01:56:44,180 --> 01:56:48,080
And they'll know we are
Christians by our love

1589
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:49,760
By our love

1590
01:56:49,860 --> 01:56:55,105
Yes, they'll know we are
Christians by our love

1591
01:56:58,820 --> 01:57:01,480
We will walk with each other

1592
01:57:01,580 --> 01:57:04,480
We will walk hand in hand

1593
01:57:04,580 --> 01:57:07,440
We will walk with each other

1594
01:57:07,540 --> 01:57:10,480
We will walk hand in hand

1595
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:14,240
And together we'll spread the news

1596
01:57:14,340 --> 01:57:18,026
that God is in our land

1597
01:57:18,140 --> 01:57:22,240
And they'll know we are
Christians by our love

1598
01:57:22,340 --> 01:57:23,865
By our love

1599
01:57:23,980 --> 01:57:30,261
Yes, they'll know we are
Christians by our love

1600
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:35,507
They'll know us by our love

1601
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:42,760
Tonight, we're asking you,
in a moment or two

1602
01:57:42,860 --> 01:57:49,120
to light a candle to symbolize
that we are going to go

1603
01:57:49,220 --> 01:57:53,920
out of this place to proclaim a gospel

1604
01:57:54,020 --> 01:57:57,069
that could bring peace to our world,

1605
01:57:57,180 --> 01:58:00,320
that could change
all the social injustice,

1606
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:03,200
and a gospel that can
transform the lives

1607
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:06,200
of millions of people
on every continent.

1608
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:09,270
And we're challenging
you tonight to do it.

1609
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:22,421
They'll know us by our love

1610
01:58:51,060 --> 01:58:55,160
They will know we are
Christians by our love

1611
01:58:55,260 --> 01:58:56,880
By our love

1612
01:58:56,980 --> 01:59:02,669
Yes, they'll know we are
Christians by our love
