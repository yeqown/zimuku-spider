1
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,530
迎著風
Brace the wind.

2
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,980
陛下  光之王已經履行了承諾
The lord of light has made good on his promise, my king.

3
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,500
他的火焰已將冰雪消融
His fires have melted the snows away.

4
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,620
前路暢通無阻
The way ahead is clear.

5
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,200
我們進軍臨冬城
We ride for Winterfell.

6
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,840
您將一舉奪下它
And you will take it.

7
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,340
光之王讓我看到波頓的旗幟熊熊燃燒
The lord has shown me Bolton Banners burning.

8
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,310
您將得到本應屬于您的東西
You will receive what is yours by right.

9
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,510
陛下
Your grace.

10
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,590
準備行軍
Prepare to form up.

11
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,600
陛下
Your grace.

12
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,930
講
Tell me.

13
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,780
士卒  黎明前逃走了很多
The men, many deserted before dawn.

14
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,390
有多少
How many?

15
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,310
將近半數
Nearly half.

16
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,900
所有傭兵和全部的馬匹
All the sellswords with all the horses.

17
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,810
陛下
Your grace.

18
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,610
盡管說  總不會比兵變更糟
Speak up. Can't be worse than mutiny.

19
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,980
把她放下來
Cut her down.

20
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,700
陛下
Your grace.

21
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,500
有人看到梅莉珊卓女士騎馬出了營地
The lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.

22
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,180
傳令集合  準備行軍
Get the men into marching formation.

23
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,520
向臨冬城進發
On to Winterfell.

24
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,020
他雙手一揚
He raised his hands

25
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,630
它們一下子都站了起來
and they all stood up at once.

26
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,640
成千上萬  世界上最龐大的軍隊
Tens of thousands of them. The biggest army in the world.

27
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,760
你打算怎么做
So what are you gonna do?

28
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,550
我打算祈禱它們別學會爬長城
I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the Wall.

29
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,010
但是龍晶...
But the dragonglass...

30
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,190
沒人拿得回來了
No one's ever getting that back now.

31
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,420
反正也是杯水車薪
It wouldn't have mattered anyway.

32
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,950
除非我們有座龍晶山
Not unless we had a mountain of it.

33
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,780
可你殺死了一個異鬼
But you killed a white walker.

34
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,230
用的是長爪
With Longclaw.

35
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,990
我眼見鋼斧在他們面前如玻璃般粉碎
I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass.

36
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,960
-可長爪...  -是瓦雷利亞鋼
- But Longclaw... - is Valyrian steel.

37
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,700
七國上下還有多少把瓦雷利亞鋼劍
How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?

38
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,000
遠遠不夠
Not enough.

39
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,120
有史以來第一個犧牲誓言兄弟性命
The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice

40
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,930
去救野人的總司令
the lives of sworn brothers to save the lives of wildlings.

41
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,920
跟黑城堡最遭憎恨的人做朋友感覺如何
How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?

42
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,060
我剛到這兒你就是我朋友了
You were friends with me when I first came here.

43
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,340
那時候可沒什么人喜歡我
And I wasn't winning any elections back then.

44
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,850
那么這一杯敬我們
Here's to us, then.

45
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,660
但憑他們嘲笑吧
Long may they sneer.

46
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,050
怎么了
What?

47
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,930
我想求你一件事
I wanted to ask you something.

48
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,470
求你為我做件事
To ask something of you.

49
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,700
送我  吉莉和孩子去舊鎮
Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown

50
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,360
讓我受訓成為學士
so I can become a maester.

51
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,490
那才是我天生該做的事  不是打仗
That's what I'm meant to be. Not this.

52
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,450
這里需要你  山姆
I need you here, Sam.

53
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,150
要是你走了  還有誰能給我可信的忠告
If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?

54
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,830
還有艾迪啊
Well, there's Edd.

55
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,630
我成為學士對你更有用
I'd be more use to you as a maester.

56
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,770
對大家都更有用  伊蒙學士不在了
More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon is gone.

57
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,560
學城有世界上最大的圖書館
The Citadel has the world's greatest library.

58
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,970
我會學習歷史
I'll learn about history,

59
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,890
策略  醫術
strategy, healing.

60
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,080
還有其他知識
And other things,

61
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,140
到時候用得上的
things that will help when--

62
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,860
那些東西來的時候
when they come.

63
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,190
如果吉莉留在這里  她會死的
If Gilly stays here, then she'll die.

64
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,530
她以我的名字命名的孩子也會死
And the baby that she named after me will die.

65
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,420
我也會死  為了保護他們
And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them.

66
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,510
那樣的話  我在世上最后所見
Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world

67
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,490
將是我沒能保護他們時她的眼神
will be the look in her eyes when I fail them.

68
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,190
我寧愿面對一千異鬼  也不愿見到那一幕
And I'd rather see a thousand white walkers than see that.

69
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,660
謝謝你
Thank you.

70
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,040
你知道學城也會讓你發誓不近女色
You know that the Citadel will make you swear off women, too.

71
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,900
他們可以試啊
Oh, they'll bloody try.

72
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,410
-山姆  -怎么啦
- Sam. - What?

73
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,970
山姆
Sam.

74
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,520
你那時剛被打了個半死  你是怎么...
You had just been beaten half to death. How did you--

75
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,340
小心翼翼唄
Oh, very carefully.

76
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,930
真高興在末日劫難之時還有人交了好運
I'm glad the end of the world's working out well for someone.

77
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,600
我會回來的
I'll come back.

78
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,960
敬你歸來
To your return.

79
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,250
敬我歸來
To my return.

80
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,050
這邊
Aye, this way.

81
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,050
小姐
My lady!

82
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,240
史坦尼斯
Stannis.

83
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,110
史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩來了  帶著軍隊
Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.

84
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,370
你怎么知道是史坦尼斯
How do you know it's Stannis?

85
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,350
他們舉著烈焰紅心旗
They're carrying his flaming heart banners.

86
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,870
我在黑水河上見過  一輩子也忘不了
From the Blackwater. I'll never forget it.

87
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,370
在這里挖戰壕
Trench here.

88
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,170
距城墻三百碼再挖一道
Another one 300 yards from the castle wall.

89
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,380
讓他們快點兒
Hurry them along.

90
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,200
在兩坡之間挖
Dig between those two rises.

91
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,020
-傳令下去  -我跟你走
- Spread out. - I'm with you.

92
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,490
-弓箭手  -傳令下去
- Archers! - Spread out!

93
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,850
馬上派人出去征收糧草
And send out a foraging party immediately.

94
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,610
日出開始圍攻
Siege begins at sunrise.

95
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,990
不會有圍攻了  陛下
There's not going to be a siege, Your Grace.

96
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,340
我們毫無勝算
We've got no chance!

97
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,670
不要  求你
No, please, please.

98
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,250
波頓還找了女人替他打仗
Bolton has women fighting for him?

99
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,610
我不為波頓家效命
I don't fight for the Boltons.

100
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,740
我是塔斯的布蕾妮
I'm Brienne of Tarth.

101
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,620
我本是藍禮·拜拉席恩的彩虹護衛
I was kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.

102
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,450
那個有你容貌的影子刺殺他時  我也在場
I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face.

103
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,970
你使用血魔法殺了他嗎
You murdered him with blood magic?

104
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,840
是的
I did.

105
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,260
以藍禮·拜拉席恩一世
In the name of Renly of house Baratheon, first of his name,

106
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,690
安達爾人和先民的真王
rightful king of the Andals and the First Men,

107
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,970
七國的統治者暨全境守護之名
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm,

108
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,510
我  塔斯的布蕾妮  判你死刑
I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die.

109
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,240
你可有遺言
Do you have any last words?

110
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,260
來吧  履行你的職責
Go on, do your duty.

111
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,320
看來我們的活兒干完了
Looks like we're done here.

112
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,260
我投降  我投降
I surrender! I surrender!

113
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,330
我接受你的投降
And I accept your surrender.

114
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,160
我們回去吧
Let's head back.

115
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,280
我妻子一定孤單了
My wife must be lonely.

116
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,410
夫人
My lady.

117
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,780
我來送您回房間去
I've come to escort you back to your chamber.

118
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,460
跟她走吧  拜托
Go with her, please.

119
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,000
我知道拉姆斯的本性
I know what Ramsay is.

120
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,220
我知道他會怎么待我
I know what he'll do to me.

121
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,290
如果注定要死
If I'm going to die,

122
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,190
就讓我趁還沒完全失卻本心前死掉
let it happen while there's still some of me left.

123
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,400
死
Die?

124
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,420
誰說你要死了
Who said anything about dying?

125
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,930
你不能死
You can't die.

126
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,030
你父親是北境守護
Your father was Warden of the North.

127
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,400
拉姆斯需要你
Ramsay needs you.

128
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,330
不過他應該不需要完整的你
Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you.

129
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,820
只需要為他生育子嗣的那些部分
Just the parts he'll use to make his heir,

130
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,240
等你生了一兩個兒子  就沒有使用價值了
until you've given him a boy or two and he's finished using them.

131
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,660
然后怎么處置那些部分  他自有好點子呢
Then he's got incredible plans for those parts.

132
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,300
所以  我們是等他回來
So, shall we wait for him to come back

133
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,900
還是這就開始
or should we begin now?

134
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,830
你要我決定嗎
You're leaving it to me?

135
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,780
太好了
Good.

136
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,920
我們開始吧
Let's begin.

137
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,350
臭佬  住手
Reek... stop!

138
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,110
住手
Stop!

139
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,230
打開大門
Open the gate!

140
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,370
他回來了
He's coming back.

141
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,750
看來我有的忙活了
I can see I have my work cut out for me.

142
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,990
你倆  出去
You two, out.

143
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,170
你是我名單上的第一個
You were the first person on my list, you know.

144
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,690
你殺了西利歐·佛瑞爾  記得他嗎
For killing Syrio Forel. Remember him?

145
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,840
很可能不記得了
Probably not.

146
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,980
還有其他幾個人
I've gotten a few of the others.

147
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,010
千面之神偷走了幾個
The many-faced god stole a few more from me.

148
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,210
但他把你留給我  我很高興
But I'm glad he left me you.

149
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,780
你知道我是誰嗎
Do you know who I am?

150
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,600
我聽不到
I can't hear you.

151
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,610
你知道我是誰
You know who I am.

152
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,500
我是艾莉亞·史塔克
I'm Arya Stark.

153
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,770
你知道你是誰嗎
Do you know who you are?

154
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,320
你是無名之輩
You're no one.

155
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,700
你什么也不是
You're nothing.

156
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,660
女孩奪走了一條命
A girl has taken a life.

157
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,340
不該奪的命
The wrong life.

158
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,930
我說對了
I was right about her.

159
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,090
是啊
You were.

160
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,860
你還沒準備好
You're not ready.

161
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,450
根本沒準備好
Not at all.

162
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,170
那人的命不該由你取
That man's life was not yours to take.

163
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,140
女孩偷了千面之神的東西
A girl stole from the many-faced god.

164
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,260
如今債已欠下
Now a debt is owed.

165
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,740
只有死亡能還人命債
Only death can pay for life.

166
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,090
不要
No! No!

167
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,530
不要  你不能死  別死啊
No, you... don't die! Don't die!

168
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,210
你為什么要哭
Why are you crying?

169
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,280
他是我朋友
He was my friend.

170
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,890
不  他不是  你沒聽他說什么嗎
No, he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?

171
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,570
他是無名之輩
He was no one.

172
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,390
可如果你是...
But if you're...

173
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,600
這是誰
Who's this?

174
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,460
無名之輩
No one at all.

175
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,270
女孩也該做無名之輩
Just as a girl should have been

176
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,170
才能拿走大廳里的臉
before she took a face from the hall.

177
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,140
臉是給無名之輩的
The faces are for no one.

178
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,080
而你仍是有名之人
You are still someone.

179
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,480
對于有名之人
And to someone,

180
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,910
臉與毒藥無異
the faces are as good as poison.

181
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,210
我看不到了
I can't see.

182
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,870
怎么回事
What's happening?

183
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,910
怎么回事
What's happening?!

184
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,330
-祝你返鄉順利  -謝謝
- I wish you a safe journey home. - Thank you.

185
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,870
原諒我  孩子
Forgive me, child.

186
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,500
我衷心祝你幸福快樂
I wish you all the happiness in the world.

187
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,000
或許我改日會來看你
Maybe I'll come visit you sometime.

188
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,190
或許我會去看你
Maybe I'll come visit you.

189
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,670
別等太久
Don't wait too long.

190
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,960
家里還有個貴婦人等著我娶
Got a noblewoman to marry back home.

191
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,360
你想要個清白的姑娘
You want a good girl,

192
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,430
但也缺不了壞壞的小婊子
but you need the bad pussy.

193
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,670
準備好了就出發  大人
Whenever you're ready, my lord.

194
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,010
別再把它弄丟了
Try not to lose it this time.

195
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,880
我再也不會取下來了
I'll never take it off again.

196
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,040
我知道你并不希望離開多恩
I know you didn't want to leave Dorne,

197
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,960
但我很高興你能回家
but I'm glad you're coming home.

198
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,490
你母親迫切地想要見你
Your mother's desperate to see you.

199
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,480
很高興崔斯丹與我們同行
I'm glad Trystane is coming with us.

200
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,030
他看上去是個好小子
He seems like a nice boy.

201
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,240
你很幸運
You're lucky.

202
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,710
指定的婚姻很少能...
Arranged marriages are rarely so--

203
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,550
指得這么好
so well arranged.

204
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,300
你覺得母親會喜歡他嗎
Do you think mother will like him?

205
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,210
只要她看到你幸福  我相信她會的
If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will.

206
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,920
你真的這么想
You really believe that?

207
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,470
你想想  除了她的孩子們
Have you ever known your mother to like anyone

208
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,170
你母親還喜歡過誰
aside from her children?

209
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,640
她喜歡你
She likes you.

210
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,930
這我可不敢肯定
I'm not so sure about that.

211
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,750
聽著
Listen...

212
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,150
我想告訴你一件事
There's something I wanted to tell you.

213
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,830
很久以前就應該告訴你了
Something I should have told you long ago.

214
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,150
怎么說呢
So...

215
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,000
既然你如今的閱歷也廣了些
Now that you've seen more of the world,

216
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,470
想必也知道世事有多復雜
you've learned how complicated things can be,

217
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,020
人心有多難測
people can be.

218
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,910
蘭尼斯特家和馬泰爾家多年來相互仇視
The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years,

219
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,100
但你卻與崔斯丹墜入愛河
but you've fallen in love with Trystane.

220
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,750
這是機緣巧合  真的  這可能性多小啊
It was an accident, really. I mean, what were the chances?

221
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,540
你碰巧愛上了那個
You happen to fall in love with the man

222
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,730
指給你的男人
you were assigned to marry?

223
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,470
我想說的是...
My point is...

224
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,080
我們無法選擇自己所愛的人
We don't choose whom we love.

225
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,090
這只是...
It just, well--

226
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,620
我們不能自持
It's beyond our control.

227
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,600
-我真像個傻瓜  -不  沒有的事
- I sound like an idiot. - No, you don't.

228
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,200
我想說的是...我想表達
What I'm trying to say-- what I'm trying

229
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,510
卻又難以啟齒的是...
and failing to say--

230
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,850
我知道你想說什么
I know what you're trying to say.

231
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,970
不  恐怕你不懂
No, I'm afraid you don't.

232
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,900
我懂
I do.

233
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,480
我都知道
I know.

234
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,520
你和母親的事
About you and mother.

235
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,200
我想我內心深處早就知道了
I think a part of me always knew.

236
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,150
并且  我很慶幸
And I'm glad.

237
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,480
我很慶幸你是我的父親
I'm glad that you're my father.

238
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,780
彌賽菈
Myrcella?

239
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,610
彌賽菈
Myrcella?

240
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,330
彌賽菈  彌賽菈
Myrcella? Myrcella?

241
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,440
你們愛她  不是嗎
You love her, don't you?

242
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,120
怎么能不愛她
How could you not?

243
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,480
當然你們的愛都是無望的
Of course it's hopeless for the both of you.

244
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,650
一個是斗技場的傭兵  一個是不名譽的騎士
A sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight.

245
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,280
誰都不適合成為女王的好夫君
Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen.

246
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:32,850
但我們誰沒有奢求一份錯位的愛情呢
But we always want the wrong woman.

247
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,390
他總是這么喜歡廢話嗎
Does he always talk so much?

248
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,890
安達爾人喬拉
Jorah the Andal.

249
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,800
灰蟲子
Torgo Nudho.

250
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,320
他不該在這兒
He should not be here.

251
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,830
沒錯  但他就在這兒
No, but he is.

252
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,380
女王已下令將他逐出城外
Our queen ordered him exiled from city.

253
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,880
若不是有他  女王就死了
Our queen would be dead if not for him.

254
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,990
{\pos(193,245)}真的  而我  如果不是這個...

255
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,830
{\pos(193,245)}小個子

256
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,400
{\pos(193,245.6)}侏儒

257
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,560
{\pos(193,245)}應該是這個詞

258
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,320
{\pos(193,245)}不好意思

259
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,000
{\pos(193,245)}我的瓦雷利亞語有點森蘇

260
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,000
{\pos(193,245)}有點生疏

261
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,990
生疏  謝謝你
Punila. Thank you.

262
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,910
我很遺憾
I am sorry.

263
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,670
當時我不在場  不能為女王而戰
Sorry I not there to fight for our queen.

264
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,960
你錯過了一場精彩的斗毆
You missed a good scrap.

265
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,190
這些都不重要了
None of that matters now.

266
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,010
我們在這兒自怨自艾
The longer we sit here bantering,

267
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,570
丹妮莉絲還困在蠻荒之地遭罪
the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.

268
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,950
他說的沒錯  龍飛向北邊
He's right. The dragon headed north.

269
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,890
如果我們要找她  就得往北走
If we're going to find her, that's where we'll have to go.

270
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,020
"我們"
We?

271
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,050
你是蘭尼斯特
You're a Lannister.

272
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,790
女王力求推翻你們家族的統治
The queen intends to remove your family from power.

273
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,630
而我要助她得償所愿
And I intend to help her do it.

274
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,710
你來這兒才幾天
You've been here for how many days now?

275
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,770
我為她而戰已有多年
I've fought for her for years.

276
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,750
最早的時候她不比孩子大多少
Since she was little more than a child.

277
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,640
-你背叛過她  -說話小心點
- You betrayed her. - Careful now.

278
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,220
她放逐了你  兩次  如果我沒記錯的話
And she exiled you. Twice, I believe.

279
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,750
第二次還是多虧了你呢
The second time thanks to you.

280
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,310
別把你犯下的罪行歸咎到我頭上  莫爾蒙
Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont.

281
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,140
他說的對  女王放逐了喬拉
He's right. Our queen exiled Jorah.

282
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,490
但他說的也沒錯  喬拉救過她的命
And he's right. Jorah saved her life.

283
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,100
或許女王對他的看法已經有所改變了
Perhaps she feels differently about him now.

284
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,280
或許不然  但我們要問過她才會知道
Perhaps not. The only way we'll know is if we ask her.

285
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:09,150
好吧  或許他可以跟我們一起
Fine, fine. I suppose he can join us.

286
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,990
只要他答應別趁我睡覺時殺了我就行
Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.

287
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,010
如果我要殺你  你的眼睛一定睜著
If I ever kill you, your eyes will be wide open.

288
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:17,910
恕我直言  我們為何要帶上你
Forgive me, but why would we bring you?

289
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,840
-什么  -你在野外追蹤過野獸嗎
- Pardon me? - Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?

290
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,760
那倒沒有  但我還有別的實用技能
Not precisely, but I have other skills that would be useful.

291
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,980
你能戰斗嗎
Can you fight?

292
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,110
我戰斗過
I have fought.

293
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,100
我沒有自稱是偉大的戰士
I don't claim to be a great warrior.

294
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,720
你騎術如何
Are you good on a horse?

295
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,400
馬馬虎虎
Middling.

296
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,090
所以你基本上只會耍嘴皮子
So mainly you talk.

297
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,140
還會喝酒  我都活這么久了
And drink. I've survived so far.

298
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,380
我對此深為佩服  但這次遠征要你無用
Which I respect, but you would not help us on this expedition.

299
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,350
你留在彌林卻可以幫助我們
You would help us here in Meereen, though.

300
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,340
我們都沒有治理城邦的經驗
None of us have experience governing a city

301
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,510
除了他
except for him.

302
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,360
你不是想向女王證明自己的價值嗎
You want to prove your value to the queen?

303
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,880
就在彌林證明吧
Prove it right here in Meereen.

304
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,560
他是個連當地語言都說不利索的異邦侏儒
He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language.

305
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,100
彌林人憑什么聽他的
Why would the Meereenese listen to him?

306
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,270
他們不聽他的
They wouldn't.

307
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,890
他們會聽灰蟲子的
They will listen to Grey Worm.

308
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,190
我要和你們同去
I'll come with you.

309
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,180
我要找到女王
I'll find our queen.

310
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,100
-你的身體狀況還不能出行  -我可以
- You are not strong enough to go anywhere. - I am.

311
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,810
他可以  他是我見過的最有種的閹人
He is. He's the toughest man with no balls I ever met.

312
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,650
可你還是不能去
But you still can't go.

313
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,000
這里的人民信任你
The people believe in you.

314
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,010
他們知道你是女王的代言人
They know you speak for the queen.

315
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:19,040
沒錯
It's true.

316
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,530
只有無垢者能維持彌林的和平
Only the unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen.

317
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,300
如果你離開
If you leave,

318
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,650
彌林肯定一分為二  自相殘殺
half this city will consume the other half.

319
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,270
還有彌桑黛
And Missandei.

320
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,710
女王最信任的人是彌桑黛
Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei.

321
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,620
肯定不是我
Certainly not me.

322
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,690
女王最親近的密友
The queen's closest confidante,

323
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,360
無垢者的指揮官
the commander of the unsullied,

324
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:40,170
以及來自異邦的疤臉侏儒
and a foreign dwarf with a scarred face.

325
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,010
祝你們好運  我的朋友們
Good fortune, my friends.

326
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:45,270
彌林古老而榮耀
Meereen is ancient and glorious.

327
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,250
盡量別毀了她
Try not to ruin her.

328
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,650
看來只有你我二人了  安達爾人喬拉
Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal.

329
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,330
我們去找幾匹好馬
Let's find some good horses.

330
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,050
路上還有說不完的話呢
We have so much to talk about.

331
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,840
你好啊  老朋友
Hello, old friend.

332
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,190
我還以為我們在一起很快樂
I thought we were so happy together

333
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,490
結果你拋棄了我
until you abandoned me.

334
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:40,140
我猜沒必要問你是怎么找到我的
I suppose there's no point asking how you found me.

335
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,750
西邊的鳥兒會唱歌  東邊的鳥兒也會唱
The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east,

336
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,550
只要你懂得如何聆聽
if one knows how to listen.

337
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:49,430
聽說你已經獲得了龍之母的垂青
They tell me you've already found favor with the mother of dragons.

338
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,510
怎么說呢  她沒有處決我
Well, she didn't execute me,

339
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,730
算是開了個好頭
so that's a promising start.

340
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:58,200
現在英雄們去找她了
Now the heroes are off to find her

341
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,080
而我困守在此
and I'm stuck here

342
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,620
意欲挽救本城于內戰邊緣
trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war.

343
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,700
老朋友有什么建議給我嗎
Any advice for an old comrade?

344
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,160
情報是關鍵
Information is the key.

345
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,030
你需要了解敵人的優勢和策略
You need to learn your enemy's strengths and strategies.

346
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:13,180
你需要知曉哪位朋友笑里藏刀
You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.

347
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:17,830
但愿我認識一個觸角無所不至的能人
If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.

348
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,340
但愿如此
If only.

349
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,280
一座雄偉的古城
A grand old city

350
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,300
因暴力  腐敗和欺騙而瀕臨崩潰
choking on violence, corruption, and deceit.

351
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:30,180
誰有經驗馴服
Who could possibly have any experience

352
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,260
如此巨大而蠢笨的野獸呢
managing such a massive, ungainly beast?

353
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,890
我真心想念你
I did miss you.

354
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,670
噢  我知道
Oh, I know.

355
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,250
我們必須回家
We have to go home.

356
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,310
可憐又可愛的孩子
Oh, my poor, sweet thing.

357
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:18,960
疼嗎
Does it hurt?

358
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,590
我們必須回家
We have to go home.

359
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,430
卓耿
Drogon.

360
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,360
你能帶我回彌林嗎
Can you take me back to Meereen?

361
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,730
你帶我飛了多遠
How far did you carry me?

362
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,670
卓耿  我們得回去
Drogon, we need to return.

363
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,550
我的人民需要我
My people need me.

364
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,250
這里沒有食物
Well, there's no food.

365
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,220
你至少給我們捕些晚飯回來啊
At the very least, you could hunt us some supper.

366
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,400
懺悔
Confess.

367
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,780
懺悔
Confess.

368
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,930
我有罪
I have sinned.

369
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,020
我現在知道了
I see that now.

370
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,980
我怎會糊涂那么久
How can I have been so blind for so long?

371
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,750
我想清潔自己
I want to be clean again.

372
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,280
我想獲得赦免
I want absolution.

373
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,940
老嫗高舉金燈來到我面前
The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high.

374
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,040
讓沐浴圣光的...
And by its holy light--

375
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,870
您想懺悔
You wish to make a confession?

376
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,430
我懺悔之后  能否放了我
Once I've confessed, will I be free?

377
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,400
對陛下的處置將視陛下的罪行而定
Your grace will be dealt with according to her sins.

378
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,550
那么愿圣母慈悲
The Mother have mercy, then.

379
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:07,680
我懺悔  我在婚外出軌
I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage. I confess.

380
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,850
跟誰
Name him.

381
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,810
藍賽爾·蘭尼斯特
Lancel Lannister.

382
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:18,030
您的堂弟  國王的侍從
Your cousin and the king's squire.

383
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,670
-我那時孤單害怕  -您有丈夫
- I was lonely and afraid. - You had a husband.

384
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,630
一個成天狎妓的丈夫...
A husband off whoring every chance he--

385
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:25,050
他的罪無法抵消您的罪
His sins do not pardon your own.

386
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,540
愿諸神寬恕我
May the gods forgive me.

387
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,190
其他男人呢
Other men?

388
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,100
沒有了
No.

389
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:37,990
沒有別人了嗎
No others?

390
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,030
沒有了
No.

391
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,990
在諸神面前撒謊可是大罪
Speaking falsehoods before the gods is a great crime.

392
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,930
您明白吧
You understand this?

393
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,040
明白
I do.

394
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,450
有人說您的孩子
There are those that say your children

395
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,720
并非您與勞勃國王所生
were not fathered by King Robert,

396
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:59,160
而是通奸亂倫的孽種
that they are bastards born of incest and adultery.

397
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,360
謊言
A lie.

398
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,060
史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩的無恥謊言
A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon.

399
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,100
他妄圖篡奪鐵王座
He wants the throne,

400
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,040
但他哥哥的孩子阻礙他即位
but his brother's children stand in his way.

401
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,270
所以他污蔑他們是野種
So he claims they are not his brother's.

402
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,610
那個混蛋
That filth.

403
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,890
根本就是一派胡言
There is not one shred of truth to it.

404
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,260
我否認
I deny it.

405
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:19,810
很好
Good.

406
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,280
但這些罪名極為嚴重
But these are terrible charges.

407
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,360
七國子民必須知道真相
And the realm must know the truth of them.

408
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,330
若陛下所言非虛
If Your Grace has given honest testimony,

409
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,500
審判必將還您清白
your trial will prove your innocence.

410
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,040
審判  我已經懺悔了
Trial? I have confessed.

411
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,380
只是其中一項罪名
To a single sin.

412
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,680
其余的您都否認了
Others you have denied.

413
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:42,450
審判將辨明真偽
Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.

414
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:47,680
謹遵總主教大人的英明裁斷
I bow to the wisdom of your high holiness.

415
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,420
但我可否請求
But if I might beg

416
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,830
圣母稍示慈悲
for just one drop of the Mother's Mercy.

Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome at the last full moon.

559
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,620
