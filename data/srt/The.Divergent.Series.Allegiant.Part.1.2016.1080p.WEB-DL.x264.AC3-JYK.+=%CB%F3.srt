where we have all but destroyed each other.

We designed you city as an experiment.

5
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:40,070
And we believe it is the only way to recover the humanity we have lost.
是因为坚信这是重拾人性的唯一途径

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,040
And we created Factions to ensure peace.

7
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,360
But we believe there will be those among you

who will transcend these factions,

these will be the Divergent.

for you to emerge from your isolation and rejoin us.

Mankind waits for you with hope, beyond the Wall.

20

Sometimes when I look past the wall,

When it's right in front of your face, you will.

People of Chicago,

记住 正式那些创建者把我们划分成了若干派系

我毕生的志愿就是追寻真相  但珍宁却让我错过了它

And for that, I humbly apologize.

不用有任何顾虑 翠丝

280
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,750
Please place your arm into the tube.
请把手放进孔道里

281
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,160
I've never felt so clean in my life.
这辈子都没这么干净过

282
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,980
That was the best weird shower I've ever had.
这是我洗过的最奇怪的澡了

283
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,830
A little cold thou.
有点儿冷 但是

284
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,780
Hey, yours is different.
你的纹身不一样

285
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,850
Why they are all different?
为什么都不一样

286
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:13,260
Hello, and welcome to the Bureau of Genetic Welfare.
你们好 欢迎各位光临基因福利局

287
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,520
In the early part of the 21st century, scientists first discovered a way to map
在21世纪上半时 科学家们首次发现并绘制了

288
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:21,660
then edit the human genome.
改变人类基因组的方法 你可以选择健康

289
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:27,550
You can choose to settle from "merely adequate" or you can choose "excellent".
你能选择保持自身的基因组 也能选择改善它们

290
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,000
A genetic solution puts you in control of your life.
基因解决方案让你可以掌控自己的生命

291
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:36,070
So, why just hope for a better future, when you can choose perfection?
为什么不期待一个更美好的未来 当你有机会选择完美时

292
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,350
Choose Perfexia.
请选择蒲飞霞

293
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:41,670
But, what started as an attempt to erase humanity's fault,
但是正如试图清楚人类缺陷一样

294
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,250
almost erased humanity itself.
人性也几乎被抹杀了

295
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,360
Genetic modification deepened the rifts between people.
基因改造加剧了人们之间的分歧

296
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:50,620
And as they got more entrenched, the world began to tear apart,
当矛盾越来越深 世界便开始四分五裂

297
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:55,730
until humanity cross a line, from which it could never return.
人类也因无法恢复原始基因而变得无可挽救

298
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,600
In the ashes of civilization,
在这片文明的废墟上

299
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:05,810
a small group of genetically unmodified individuals established the "BUREAU OF GENETIC WELFARE."
一小群基因未被改造的人建立了你们今天所在的这个基因福利局 “基因福利局”

300
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,120
here in Chicago's O'Hare Airport.
在这儿 芝加哥的奥黑尔机场

301
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,260
Our mission is to oversee a grand experiment
我们的任务是监控一项重要的实验

302
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,570
to purify the human genome.
其目的就是净化人类的基因组

303
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,260
That experiment is the city of Chicago.
而实验室就是芝加哥市

304
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:24,000
Your participation in the Bureau's work means you are now the guardians of the future.
你们参与到了基因局的工作 就意味着成为了人类未来的守护者

305
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,300
Your destiny begins today.
你们的使命从今天开始

306
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,720
Now. Please follow me.
现在请跟我来

307
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:45,700
What's an airport?
机场是什么鬼

308
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,330
Life in the Bureau can be demanding.
在这儿生活限制很多

309
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,890
The work is worth every sacrifice.
但是我们的值得为此付出

310
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,870
We don't have all the resources we would like of course,
基因局并不是要什么就有什么

311
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,880
but I think you'll find your accommodations more than adequate
但足以满足你们的基本生活

312
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:58,970
- Whoa. - Wow.
哇

313
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,340
They're in person, here.
他们是真人啊

314
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,710
- Who are they? - We bring them in from the Fringe.
他们是谁  从边界带回来的

315
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:05,540
Get them healthy. Give them a second chance.
等他们治好了 就能活下去了

316
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,370
- Hi, Four. - Hi, Four.
老四

317
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,080
Hi, Four.
老四

318
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,140
Now they know who we are.
他们怎么知道我们的

319
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,640
The experiment is the entire focus of the Bureau.
实验室是整个基因局的焦点

320
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:18,900
Our Surveillance Technology is centuries ahead of anything you know in Chicago.
我们的监控技术领先你们芝加哥几个世纪

321
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,560
They grown up watching you.
他们看着你们长大

322
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,930
Nothing creepy about that.
你可吓着我们了

323
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,000
You have to forgive everyone for staring, but...
请原谅所有人都盯着你们看  但..

324
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:30,720
your arrival is the most exciting event some of us have ever known.
你们的到来对我们来说是件大事

325
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,900
Welcome to your new home.
欢迎来到新家

326
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,020
Where's Four? Did you hurt him?
老四在哪里 伤着他了吗

327
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,660
I told you I wanted them unharmed.
我说过我要他们几个毫发无损

328
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:44,240
He went with them. Willing.
跟他们走了 是自愿的

329
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,500
- But he's alive. - Did you hear what I'm saying?

330
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,380
He betrayed you.

331
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,080
No...

What do you think?
想什么呢

337
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,280
I think they've been studying us for 200 years and we need to catch up.
他们研究了我们200年 我们得迎头赶上

338
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:20,050
We're going to give it a chance, right?
我们得抓住机会对吗

339

344
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,700
Since you were the one who opened the box which invited you here.

352
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,770
I just never imagined the world to be this big.
我从没想过还有次芝加哥大的地方

353
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:57,050
Chicago is just one of 50 major cities that used to exist
在北美 芝加哥只是过去50个大城市中的一个

354
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,750
on this continent along.
除此之外

355
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:03,300
Beyond that is, oceans and more land than you can imagine.

I saw the love that your mother and father had for you.
我看到了你父母对你的爱

368
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:26,610
I watched a little girl have a happy childhood and grow into a courageous young woman

377
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,270
The people at Erudite really made a mess of things,
博学派的人真是够可以的

378
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,930
but I don't want your to worry about that.
但我不想你为这些担心

379
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:58,950
Restoring order in Chicago is as important to me as it is to you.
恢复芝加哥的秩序对你和我都很重要

380
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,710
It's the only way to save the "damaged".
这是拯救缺陷者的唯一办法

381
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,140
What is the "damaged".
什么是缺陷者

382
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,310
The genetic alterations had disastrous consequences.
基因改造产生了严重的后果

383
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,820
Too brave and you're cruel. Too peaceful and you're passive.
太勇敢会变得残忍 太平和会变得懦弱

384
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:13,670
Too smart, and you'll lose compassion, like your brother.
太聪明会变得冷酷 就像你哥哥

385
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:16,880
- Caleb's "damaged"? - Yes.
凯莱布是缺陷者吗  没错

386
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,180
For nearly 200 years,
近200年来

387
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,150
the greatest scientific minds have live here to test a theory.
顶尖的科学家们在这儿验证一个理论

388
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:24,320
If we can rescue genetically damaged people
如果我们能把边界地带

389
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,140
from the toxic environment in the Fringe.
有毒环境中的基因缺陷者

390
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:28,490
and put them in a safe place like Chicago,
放在像芝加哥这样安全的城市里

391
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:33,070
then perhaps over time, man's genetic material would heal itself.
也许久而久之 人们的基因就能治愈自己

392
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,350
Return to its original form.
这样就可以回到原来的样子了

393

394
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,980
You're the only one.
你是唯一的一个

395
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,160
That doesn't- That doesn't make any sense
你这么说没道理 我是说

396
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,490
Four is divergent. There's lot of divergences.
老四也是分歧者 还有很多分歧者

397
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,340
Not divergent, Tris. Pure.
不是分歧者  翠丝  是纯净者

398
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:52,090
You're genetically "pure". The rest are still "damaged".
你是基因纯净者  其他人都是缺陷者

399
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,710
- Four? - Damaged.
老四呢  缺陷者

400
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,010
Not as much as Caleb, but "damaged".
不像凯莱布那么严重  但也是缺陷者

401
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,630
If we can understand what made you,
如果我们能知道是什么治愈了你

402
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,910
maybe we can use that knowledge to help the "damaged".
也许我们就能帮助其他的缺陷者了

403
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,200
What does this have to do with Chicago?
但这跟芝加哥有什么关系

404
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,160
I answer to the Council.
我会向委员会汇报

405

I'm going to bring you with me to Providence to meet them.
我准备带你去见他们

408
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:23,110
When they see that it's possible, that you were possible,

409
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,010
it will change everything.

410
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:28,080
I understand it's hard to take my word for it.
我明白我的话很难的到信任

411
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:32,090
But, if you don't believe me, believe your mother.
但是若果你不相信我 就相信你母亲

412

我理解你的愤怒 伊芙琳 真的

546
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:05,670
- But the way forward... - The way forward has already began.
但是未来的路 -未来的路已经铺好了

547
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:11,240
I know I said I'd be alone, but...
我说过我会一个人来

548
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:13,860
I'm not Candor and I'm not Amity.
但我不是诚实派也不是友好派

549
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:17,620
So I will lie and I will fight if I have to.
所以我撒了谎 如果有必要的话我还会战斗

550
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:21,850
You see these scars? I wasn't born Amity.
看见这些伤疤了吗？我不是出生在友好派

551
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:27,040
And I can assure you I'm not afraid to fight for what I believe in.
我能向你保证 我并不害怕为信念而战

552
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,950
It seems like we're 2 peas in a pot.
看来我们是同一类人

553
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:33,860
But it doesn't have to be this way.
但并不一定非要这种方式

554
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:36,610
We can come to some sort of agreement.
我们可以好好商量

555
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:41,020
- Get back! - Get down!
退后 ！-趴下

556
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,530

557
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,190
- Go! - Go.
快-快

558
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:56,080
Alright, Caleb.
听着 凯莱布

559
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:58,860
Keep me posted if anything changes, alright?
万一情况有变通知我好吗？

560
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,080
- Hi. - Hey.
你好-你也是

561
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,940
Caleb said that some of the Dauntless are lining with Johanna.
凯莱布说无畏派的一些人站到了约翰娜这边

562
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,870
But the rest of Candor are still solid with Evelyn.
但剩下的诚实派还和伊芙琳一个阵营

563
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:16,550
Things are  finally out of control.
局势就快失去控制了

564
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,530
Did David say anything about what he can do?
大卫说过他能做什么吗？

565
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:22,810
Yeah, once we talk to the Council, then the Bureau can step in.
我们跟委员会谈完 基因局会介入

566
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:28,270
So, it all hinges on the mysterious Council, does it?
所以这全靠神秘的委员会了 对吧？

567
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:31,950
- What if they say no? - David is confident that they won't.
他们不同意怎么办？ -大卫有信心说服他们

568
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,660
David, right.
大卫，好吧

569
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:40,390
You know, I found out why I can't go upstairs.
你知道，我搞清楚自己为什么不能上去了

570
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:45,150
I'm "damaged", and you're "pure".
我是缺陷者 你是纯净者

571
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,280
I know.
我知道

572
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:51,920
You know. When were you going to tell me?
你知道 你打算什么时候告诉我？

573
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,670
I don't know. I...
我不知道 我……

574
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,670
- I guess I didn't think that it matter. - Why doesn't it matter?
但我觉得这并不重要-为什么不重要？

575
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:02,290
Because it doesn't make a difference if you're "pure" or  you're "damaged".
因为不管是纯净者还是缺陷者都没什么区别

576
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:06,510
You're still the same person to me.
对我来说你就是你

577
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:15,660
Look. I know that it's not perfect, by any means, but...
听着 我知道无论如何它都不完美

578
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,300
The Bureau saved my mother from the Fringe. I wouldn't be here without her.
但基因局从边界地带救出了我妈妈，没有他们我也不会再这儿

579
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:21,220
What do you actually know about what they do in the Fringe?
我们真的了解他们在哪儿做过什么吗？

580
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:23,770
You know what they tell you.

581

- Yeah, but... - I'm sorry.

Those people are nice, weird, but nice.

Yeah. They're definitely weird, that's for sure.

- Really? - Yeah.
是吗？ -没错

Next time you go to the Fringe, I want in.

593
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:20,620

594
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,070
I've watched you both enough to know that
但我已经观察你们很久了

595
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:26,250
I think the two of you are going to work it out.

外面的人平均能活多久？  -25到30岁

如果小时候就被救了，在基因局能活到50-60岁

无畏派 如果是我就不会让你们来这儿

But yes, it is shocking to me.

It doesn't work.
这是没用的

也许是时候接受所有人了，而不是把他们分在不同的群体里

01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,640
and you are doing nothing to help them.

David has control over the administration of Chicago.

798
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,830
He's only here to extend his funding.

You said that you couldn't do anything.

I am doing something. I'm bring back the factions.
我在行动了  我在重建派别制度

804
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,700
What? Why?
什么？为什么？

805
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:54,470
I hope the Allegiant will take care of the problem for me.

The factions work, Tris.

They keep the peace, they created you.

I never should have trusted you.

You okay?
