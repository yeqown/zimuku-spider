1
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,540
媽媽
Mom

2
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,460
凱特   你還好吧
Kat   You okay

3
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,840
沒事 我很好
Yeah. I'm fine.

4
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,260
瞧您這濃妝淡抹的
Why are you all dressed up

5
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,350
你啥意思
What do you mean

6
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,020
現在幾點了
What time is it

7
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,640
差不多五點左右
Almost five.

8
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,150
不會吧
Really

9
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,230
我得去準備夜飯了
I need to get dinner started.

10
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,910
我媽媽失蹤那年 我剛17歲
I was 17 when my mother disappeared.

11
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,120
那時我渾渾噩噩 除了荷爾蒙過剩的身體髮膚
Just as I was becoming nothing but my body,flesh and blood,

12
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,460
什麼也沒有
and raging hormones.

13
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,050
而我媽卻已經連軀體也拋棄了
She stepped out of hers and left it behind.

14
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,910
風雪中的白鳥

15
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,810
嗨 希爾曼夫人 菲爾在家嗎
Hi,Mrs. Hillman. Is Phil home

16
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,480
不 不好意思 凱特麗娜 他還沒回來
No. I'm sorry,Katrina. He's... he's not back yet.

17
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,030
真的
Really

18
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,240
說好要來學校接我的
Supposed to pick me up from school.

19
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,870
他一定在路上了 你知道他的為人
I'm sure he's on his way. You know how he is.

20
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,450
呃 進來坐會等等他吧
Uh,w... w... would you like to come in and... and wait for him

21
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,710
不用了 告訴他我來過就行
That's okay. Just tell him that I stopped by.

22
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,290
當然
I will.

23
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,630
謝謝您 希夫人
Thanks,Mrs. Hillman.

24
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,130
喔 不客氣 親愛的
Oh,no problem,dear.

25
00:03:49,310 --> 00:04:01,320
1988年 秋冬

26
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,790
老爸
Dad

27
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,170
你這麼早回家了
What are you doing home already

28
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,380
看到你媽了嗎
Have you seen your mother

29
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,590
沒有 怎麼
No,why

30
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,930
她走了
She's gone.

31
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,100
"她走了"是啥意思
What do you mean she's gone

32
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,520
我回到家 她不在
I came home and she wasn't here.

33
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,770
她可能在買東西什麼的
She's probably at the store or something.

34
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,190
她的車還在車庫
Her car is in the garage.

35
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,320
哦 天啊 別逗了 她會回來的
Oh my God,stop being so melodramatic. She'll turn up.

36
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,360
我給所有人都打過電話 但沒人說見過她
I called everyone. Nobody's seen her.

37
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,660
爸 別擔心啦 我相信一切都會好好的
Dad,don't worry. I'm sure everything's fine.

38
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,080
嗯
Yeah.

39
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,040
我回房去了
I'm going to my room.

40
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,970
是啊 太離譜了 媽媽連個字條都沒留
Yeah,it was weird. She didn't leave a note or anything.

41
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,180
爸爸卻已經心煩意亂了
And dad is totally freaking out.

42
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,180
你覺得她會去哪
Where do you think she is

43
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,060
也許她最終選擇離開他
Maybe she finally left him.

44
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,310
被威懾了那麼多年
She's been threatening to for all these years.

45
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,310
那 她有沒有什麼 古怪的行為
Well,was she,like,acting weird or something

46
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,190
絲毫沒有
No weirder than usual.

47
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,610
對了 你倒提醒我了 上禮拜我放學回家
Actually,no. Last week I came home from school

48
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,150
看見她睡在我的床上
and I found her sleeping in my bed.

49
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,650
啥
What

50
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,200
對啊 很隨便 對吧
Yeah. Random,Right

51
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,030
她醒來的時候 貌似有點
When she woke up,she seemed like,

52
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,660
迷迷糊糊
all confused and out of it.

53
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,660
我覺得她還在半睡半醒之間
I think she was still half in a dream.

54
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,540
好了 說說你 你今天去哪了
So,anyways,where the hell were you today

55
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,090
哦 對
Oh,yeah.

56
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,670
對不起 我 我在托馬斯商場逛了很久 之後
Sorry,I... I was hanging out at Thomas',and...

57
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,130
之後你嗑藥了
And you were stoned.

58
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,510
呃 算是吧
Uh,maybe.

59
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,100
要我來你那嗎
You want me to come over

60
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,520
我不知道 我有好多作業要做呢
I don't know,I kind of have a lot of homework to do.

61
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,600
啥時候你開始關心什麼狗屁作業了
Since when do you give a shit about homework

62
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,480
我媽媽開始關心起我的成績來了
My mom's been on my case lately about my grades.

63
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,940
菲爾 我們有多久沒搞了 一個多禮拜了吧
Phil,we haven't had sex in,like,over a week.

64
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,650
我好想愛愛
I miss fucking you.

65
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,030
我也一樣 寶貝 但老話說的好
Same here,babe. But,you know what they say.

66
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,250
"小別勝新婚"
Absence makes the heart get stronger.

67
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,210
是啊
Yeah.

68
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,750
菲爾 還沒睡吧
Phil,are you in there

69
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,090
我在打電話
I'm on the phone.

70
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,170
你能出來一會嗎 兒子
Could you come out here for a minute,honey

71
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,760
我聽到外面有古怪的聲音
I heard a strange noise outside.

72
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,800
你總是各種幻聽
You're always hearing strange noises.

73
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,220
行 我一會就來
Yeah,I'll be out in a sec.

74
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:38,480
我要掛了 我的瘋媽又在胡思亂想了
I gotta go. My crazy mom is imagining things again.

75
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,770
嗯嗯 回聊
Hmm okay. Talk to you later.

76
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,030
拜拜
Okay.

77
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,040
還是沒消息
So,no word

78
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,920
你覺得我們應該報警嗎
You think we should call the police

79
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,420
我不想搞的左右鄰居都來圍觀
I don't want them coming here for all the neighbors to see.

80
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,550
你媽媽也不喜歡這樣
Your mother wouldn't like it.

81
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,610
如果到明早還沒有音訊
If we don't hear anything by morning,

82
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,230
我們去電台登個尋人啟事
let's take a drive down to the station.

83
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,080
媽媽
Mom

84
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,550
媽媽
Mom

85
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,280
媽媽
Mom

86
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,660
媽媽 你怎麼了
Mom,what happened

87
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,050
當我還是小孩子時 我媽媽想給我
When I was little,my mother tried...

88
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,010
做一頭卷髮
to curl my hair.

89
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,770
哦 好吧 反正也嘗試過了
Oh,well. We tried.

90
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,560
瞅著有點太飄柔了 我想
It looks a little fuller,I suppose.

91
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,530
她給我起名叫凱特麗娜 這樣她就可以叫我凱特
She named me Katrina so that she could call me Kat,

92
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,360
因為她一直想要個寵物
because she always wanted a pet.

93
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:39,580
來 凱特 學貓叫 來 小貓咪 叫幾聲
Come here,Kat. Purr for me,kitty. Come on. Purr.

94
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,120
喵 喵 喵
Purr. Purr. Purr.

95
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:47,210
太棒了 真乖 真是聽話的小貓咪
That's it. Good,good little kitty.

96
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,330
多年啦 我都覺得自己是她的寵物貓
For years I thought I was her pet.

97
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,350
凱特 凱特
Kat Kat

98
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,150
媽媽
Mama

99
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,990
我在這兒 凱特 在這兒
I'm here,Kat. I'm here.

100
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,880
不許再吃了 天啊 你都肥成什麼樣了
No more for you. God,you're getting fatter by the hour.

101
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,510
媽媽想讓我長成窈窕淑女
My mother always wanted me to be a sylph,

102
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,510
如她一樣輕盈優雅
all lithe and elegant like her.

103
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,730
當我步入青春 我的身體與日俱變
And when I hit puberty,my body changed seemingly overnight,

104
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,940
身材如同陽光下的雪人一樣蛻變
the bulk melting off like I was a snowman in the sun.

105
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,270
只是 沒有讓她開心
Only,instead of finally pleasing her,

106
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,820
反而被她嫌棄了
that somehow made her resent me even more.

107
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,950
你喜歡那男孩嗎   天啊 你嚇死我了
Do you love the boy   God,Jesus,you scared me.

108
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,820
你啥時候進來的
How long have you been standing there

109
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,490
抱歉 我不是想嚇你
Sorry,I didn't mean to startle you.

110
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,250
該回答我的問題了吧
Well,are you going to answer my question

111
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,290
啥問題
What question

112
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,670
隔壁的男孩 你愛上他了
That boy next door. Do you love him

113
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,840
你在說什麼啊 不關你的事
What are you talking about It's none of your business.

114
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,800
我不愛你的父親
I don't love your father.

115
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,970
事實上我對他無法忍受
I can't stand him,as a matter of fact.

116
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,270
搞什麼 跟我說這些
What the fuck Why would you say that to me

117
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,310
滾出去跟別人說去
Go fuckin' tell it to someone else.

118
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,730
沒有留字條
So no note,huh

119
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,780
沒 什麼都沒有
No. Nothing.

120
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,330
你說她連包都沒背
You say she didn't pack a bag.

121
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,670
就我目前所知 家裏什麼也沒丟
Well,nothing seems to be missing as far as I can tell.

122
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,510
這警官是那種和我爸 菲爾 都截然不同的男人
The detective was the polar opposite of men like my father,and Phil.

123
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,560
他是攜槍上陣的人
He was the kind of man who carried a gun,got into fights,

124
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,060
神擋殺神 佛擋殺佛
killed things with his bare hands.

125
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,480
她是否抑鬱
Was she depressed

126
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,600
有沒有服藥或接受治療呢 有沒有別的
Was she on any kind of medication,or taking anything

127
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,190
我媽她不會自殺的
She didn't kill herself,

128
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,900
如果你是想暗示什麼的話
if that's what you're trying to imply.

129
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,030
嗯 好消息是
Well,the good news is that,

130
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,370
目前本市所有醫院和殯儀館暫無匹配
there's no matches at any of the hospitals or morgue.

131
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,290
也沒有暴力犯罪的證據
No evidence of foul play.

132
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,670
然而 我最不想說的是
However,and I hate to be the one to tell you this,

133
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:42,130
每周有上百名人妻走失
hundreds of wives go missing every week.

134
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,680
老兄 如果一個女人想人間蒸發 她是可以做到的
If a woman wants to vanish,buddy,she can.

135
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,050
你是說我們無能為力了
Are you saying there's nothing we can do

136
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,810
哦 對
Oh,sure there is.

137
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,980
我建議你提醒下朋友與鄰居
I recommend you alert your friends,your neighbors.

138
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,690
讓他們隨時張望注意
Tell them to be on the lookout.

139
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,560
留心你的銀行賬戶 你信用卡的
Keep an eye on your bank account,your credit cards,

140
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,480
任何使用記錄
for any kind of activity.

141
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,690
家裏有錄音電話嗎
Got an answering machine

142
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,280
很好 開著就行 你妻子可能會試圖聯繫你
Good,keep it on. Your wife might try to contact you.

143
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,950
如果有轉機 空閒時通知我一聲
Feel free to call me if anything comes up.

144
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,400
老爸
Dad

145
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,360
你媽媽從沒有愛過我
Your mother never loved me.

146
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,450
我不知道該說什麼 因為我記不起媽媽
I didn't know what to say,because I couldn't remember

147
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,120
曾以哪怕輕蔑的眼神看著爸爸
my mother ever looking at my dad with anything but contempt.

148
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,870
也許很久很久之前
Maybe a zillion eons ago

149
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,960
當他們還年輕時 事情會大不相同了
when they were young,it was different.

150
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,050
超贊 對吧
It's perfect,right

151
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,430
這正是我想要的一切
It's everything I've ever wanted.

152
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,810
她高挑 靚麗
She was tall,stunning,

153
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,940
如同電影明星
like a movie star.

154
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,860
他們是典型的美國好夫妻
They were the quintessential American couple,

155
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,780
未來如綿延無盡的魔毯在他們面前鋪開
the future unfurling before them like some endless magic carpet.

156
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,860
如果做家務是一門藝術或科學
If homemaking was an art or science,

157
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,780
我媽可以拿到諾貝爾獎
my mother would have won a Nobel Prize.

158
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,700
但是 一旦房子完美無瑕
But once the house is immaculate,

159
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,830
一切就緒
and everything was in its place,

160
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,160
她就碌碌無為
she had nothing left to do

161
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,000
空虛度日
but plan the emptiness of days to come.

162
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,880
歲月如梭 曾經的美婦逐漸
And gradually,the beautiful woman she once was

163
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,880
淪落為一個暴風雪中徘徊的幽靈
became no more than a phantom,wandering away in a snowstorm.

164
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,260
你好 親愛的 晚飯吃什麼
Hello,sweetheart. What's for dinner

165
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,520
墨西哥雞肉卷   哇哦 流口水啊
Meatloaf.   Oh,yum.

166
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,480
你做的肉卷是最好吃的
Your meatloaf is the cat's meow.

167
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,900
對了 還記得我在辦公室抽獎活動上買的刮刮卡嗎
So anyway,Do you remember that ticket I bought at the office raffle

168
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,940
我好像忘了   猜猜怎麼著 我刮中了
Not really.   Well,guess what I won.

169
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,570
刮了個燉鍋   咱家用不著燉鍋
It's a crock pot.   We don't need a crock pot.

170
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,030
什麼玩意兒用不著啊
What are you talking about

171
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,870
這可是最新產品 人手一個的
These are the latest thing. Everyone's getting one.

172
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:16,080
你可以燉川味螞蟻上樹 水煮肉片什麼的
You can make,uh,stews,pot roast,chili.

173
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,160
哦 我沒時間講究這些
Well,I don't have time to fuss with it now.

174
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,580
我要做飯了
I have to finish dinner.

175
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,960
先放著吧 放冰箱上面就行
Just put it out of the way. Over there,on top of the fridge.

176
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,670
他是受氣包
He was her doormat.

177
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,220
可他又放任媽媽衝他撒野
She treated him like shit and he let her.

178
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,550
你可以想像一下 當我看到工作時的父親的那種震驚程度
So imagine my shock when I visited my father

179
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,020
他在職場如魚得水
at work one day and discovered he had game.

180
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,810
每個女人都在和他調情
Every woman there was into him.

181
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,140
眉來眼去 暗送秋波
Flirting with him,batting their eyelashes.

182
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,440
早上好 康納斯先生 這位美麗的小姐是誰呀
Good morning,Mr. Connors. And who is this pretty young lady

183
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,150
早上好 敏蒂 這是凱特 新來的前台
Good morning,Mindy. This is Kat,the new receptionist.

184
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,850
我震驚了
I was stunned.

185
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,990
這些女人都覺得我老爸非常性感迷人
These women actually thought my dad was hot.

186
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,950
但在我老媽眼裏 他卻是苦逼的象徵
But to my mother,he would always be pathetic.

187
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,880
就像口生物鐘
A constant reminder of

188
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,750
時刻提醒她忍受那難以忍受的重複生活
the unbearable repetition

189
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,580
以及生命中的乏味無趣
and dullness of her life.

190
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,050
兩人的婚姻如同冰泉上
My parents' marriage was like a long drink of water

191
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,760
長久飲啜
from a frozen fountain.

192
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,130
冰冷入骨 讓你牙齒也冷到透明
So cold it turns your teeth to diamonds.

193
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,760
知道他們的性生活糟糕透頂 也毫不為奇
It was hardly a surprise to learn their sex life sucked.

194
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,560
同時 爸爸還有自己的私密抽屜
Meanwhile,My father had his own drawer of secrets.

195
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,150
他們就這樣過日子
So they just went on like that.

196
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,990
我媽媽從不動情 爸爸在地下室擼管
My mom never coming,my dad jacking off in the basement,

197
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,120
所有的一切偽裝成美好
all the while pretending everything was fine.

198
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,740
這就是他媽的美好人生中
That we were the perfect family

199
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,370
他媽的美好家庭
living this perfect fucking life.

200
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,060
黃油遞給我一下
Pass the butter.

201
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,690
謝謝
Thank you.

202
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,070
好幾次我覺得她都要瘋了
There were times when I thought she was going mad,

203
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,200
感覺她簡直是要用枕頭先把老爸捂死
that she was going to suffocate my father one night with a pillow,

204
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,410
然後像個神經病一樣放火燒咱家房子
that she was going to burn the fucking house down.

205
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,790
但事實相反 她消失了
But instead,she vanished.

206
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,000
你對此有何感受
How does that make you feel

207
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,540
我不知道
I don't know.

208
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,000
你不知道
You don't know

209
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:35,340
你想念她嗎   不 一點也不
Do you miss her   No. Not really.

210
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,430
爸爸讓我去見心理醫生 因為他認為
My dad made me see a shrink because he thought

211
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,350
媽媽失蹤後 我要處理好對母親的情感
I needed to process my feelings about my mother leaving.

212
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:44,270
但問題是 我壓根沒有情感
Thing is,I didn't have any feelings.

213
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,360
泰勒醫生讓我感覺
Dr. Thaler reminds me of

214
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,230
她就像一個扮演心理醫生的女演員
an actress playing a therapist.

215
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,110
而當我們會面時 我感覺我也成了演員 在扮演自己
And when we have a session,I feel like an actress playing myself.

216
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,570
我 我 之後不久我做過很多奇特的夢
I,I act... I have been having kind of weird dreams lately.

217
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,780
一個蹩腳演員 展現蹩腳的演技
A bad actress. Doing a shitty job.

218
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:05,000
夢裏面 我開車 穿過凌烈的暴風雪
Like,I'm,um,I'm driving through this gnarly snow storm

219
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,620
什麼也看不見 到處都是飄花
and I can't see anything,I mean,there's snow everywhere.

220
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,540
不知打哪兒來 景象就顯現了
And then out of nowhere,this figure appears.

221
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,510
我無法描述它的細節
I can't,like,make it out in any detail or anything,

222
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,590
但我知道 那就是我的媽媽
but I just somehow know that it's my mother.

223
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,930
我試圖掉頭 但我感到汽車撞到了什麼
And I try to swerve,but I can feel the car hit something.

224
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,720
我走出車門 四下望去
I get out,and I look all around

225
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,600
可外面沒有人也沒有東西
but there's no body,nothing.

226
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,810
只有大雪和刺眼的白色
Just snow and blinding whiteness everywhere.

227
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,730
自從媽媽離開後 我一直在做這種夢
I... I've been having these dreams ever since my mom left.

228
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,150
這不尋常
That's not unusual,

229
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,900
特別是考慮到你目前情況的創傷
especially given the trauma of your situation.

230
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,120
然而 根據主流理論
However,contrary to popular belief,

231
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,200
夢並不一定要暗指什麼
dreams don't necessarily mean anything.

232
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,950
人人都做奇怪的夢
We all have strange dreams.

233
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,210
但大多數情況下 只是大腦的一種功能
But in most cases,it's just your brain's way

234
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,830
在一天結束時散發思維
of letting off steam at the end of the day.

235
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,460
喔
Oh.

236
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,300
我很擔心你 凱特
I'm worried about you,Kat.

237
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,680
什麼意思
What do you mean

238
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,890
你一個人要處理的問題太多了
This is too much to deal with on your own.

239
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,270
你看的那個心理醫生有什麼幫助嗎
Is that shrink you're seeing helping any

240
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,480
我想 只有幾次吧
I guess. I've only been a couple of times.

241
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,770
嗯 我媽說過
Yeah,well,my mom said

242
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,190
我爸走後 浴療對她幫助很大
therapy helped her a lot after my dad left.

243
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,990
但我始終不能理解 她會對你做出這種事情來
I still don't understand how she could do this to you.

244
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,460
我猜她想離家出走   那不是理由
She wanted out,I guess.   So That's no excuse.

245
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,960
至少我爸離開時還跟我們說了
Least my dad told us he was leaving.

246
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:39,300
而不是把我們留在夜色之中 獨自彷徨
He didn't just leave us in the dark,wondering.

247
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:45,100
隨他去吧 我們可不可以少說話多做愛
Whatever. Can we just stop talking and fuck

248
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,350
我媽崩潰前我得回去
Gotta get back before my mom freaks out.

249
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,690
再說你爸不是要回來了嗎
Plus isn't your dad coming home soon

250
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,020
不 一小時內不會
No,not for at least an hour.

251
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,770
嗯 好吧 我最怕他把我倆捉姦在床
Yeah,well,last thing I want is for him to catch us again.

252
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,400
上次他那麼惱火 簡直就像要宰了我
Last time he got so mad I thought he was gonna kill me.

253
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,450
至少 給你的心理醫生一次機會 好嗎
Just,give your shrink a chance,will you

254
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,200
好吧
All right.

255
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:09,700
說真的 你得釋放一點怒火
Seriously. You need to let some of your anger out.

256
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,750
不然你就崩潰了 像你媽那樣
You're gonna crack. Just like your mom.

257
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,590
就像一個惡性循環
It's like a vicious circus.

258
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,220
晚點再來接你
Catch you later.

259
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,100
我並不是想聳人聽聞
I don't mean to sound crass,

260
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,480
但再不做愛 我就要爆炸了
but if I don't get some dick soon I'm going to explode.

261
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,810
加入性愛俱樂部吧 妹子
Join the fucking club,sister.

262
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,520
看看光明的一面 至少做愛是真槍實彈
Look on the bright side. At least you've had real sex.

263
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,940
我超恐艾滋
I'm so paranoid about AIDS

264
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,440
咱們可以並肩作戰
I have to live vicariously through you.

265
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,780
好吧 可問題是一旦你床上實戰了
Okay,well,the problem is that once you've had real sex,

266
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,490
你就會日煩夜煩 朝思暮想
it's,like,all you can ever think about.

267
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,030
菲爾幾乎再沒有碰過我
And Phil barely even touches me anymore.

268
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,540
只有說晚安時那種淺吻
He,like,gives me goodnight peck and that's it.

269
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,330
啥 那也太沒趣了
What That's fucked up.

270
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,460
我知道 我倆就像上了年紀的老夫老妻
I know. It's,like,we're some old married couple.

271
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,290
也許你可以去勾搭那個火辣的警官
Maybe you should bang that hot detective you're so into.

272
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,590
啥 胡說八道 他都40了
What What are you talking about He's,like,40.

273
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,380
他搞我這未成年可是犯法的
That's not even legal I don't think.

274
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,880
凱特 他是個條子 只有條子才知道
Kat,he's a cop. if anyone knows how to do shit

275
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,840
如何瞞天過海 他可以
without getting caught,he does.

276
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,560
是啊 再說了 幾周後你就滿18歲了
Yeah,plus you'll be 18 in a few weeks anyway.

277
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,220
好吧 不管怎麼說
Okay,whatever.

278
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,730
我可不想勾搭一個40歲的老條子
I am not screwing a 40 year old cop.

279
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,400
行嗎 還是言歸正傳 幫我想想
Okay Back to the problem at hand,

280
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,650
怎麼讓菲爾來和我上床
getting Phil to fuck me.

281
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,730
這個嘛 你和他溝通過嗎
Well,have you talked to him about it

282
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,740
試過 他總說什麼自己有負罪感啦
I tried. All he says is that,uh,he's got a lot on his mind,

283
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,620
讓我放他一馬饒了他啦
and that I need to cut him some slacks.

284
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,540
我的天啊 真他娘的白癡
Oh my God,what a fucking moron

285
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,080
我知道 我知道 菲爾在這方面是個白癡
I know. I know Phil's not the brightest crayon in the box.

286
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,250
本世紀最保守的男人
That is the understatement of the century.

287
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,630
這正是我喜歡他的原因 懂嗎
That's what I kind of like about him,you know

288
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:43,170
簡單 純一
It's just simple.

289
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,300
說出來不怕你們笑話
I know that sounds perverse,

290
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,380
他是像我爸爸的那一類人
but he's kind of like my dad in that way.

291
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,540
如果你願意
You can scratch the surface

292
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,350
可以像洋蔥一樣一層一層地剝開他的心
and there's just more surface.

293
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,850
我搞到了偉哥
I'm gonna get straight Cs

294
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,980
給我看
Show me.

295
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,820
天啊 你真是太瘋狂了
My God,you're so fuckin' crazy

296
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:13,120
菲爾就是我前文說的隔壁男孩
Phil is literally the boy next door.

297
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,540
但他和他媽去年搬進來時
And when he and his mother moved in last year,

298
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,080
我直接很鄙視他
I instantly despised him.

299
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,460
他遲鈍而又傻缺
He was so dull and stupid.

300
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:25,760
我取笑他 給他起了個響亮的外號 垃圾仔
I made fun of him. Even earned a special nickname: Garbage.

301
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:32,010
但那年夏夜 一切都變了
But then,one night that summer,everything changed.

302
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,850
我 貝絲和米奇
Me,Beth and Mickey,

303
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,310
我們每週三都做那些事
We were doing what we did every Wednesday.

304
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,270
比以往感覺更乏味了
And even more bored than usual.

305
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,190
有時候我真希望 有人能把這地方燒成平地
Sometimes I wish someone would burn this place to the ground

306
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,990
那樣我們就不用再來了
so we didn't have to come here anymore.

307
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,320
可不是嘛
Oh,tell me about it.

308
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,370
每周都是這群同樣的爛人
Every week it's the same fucking people

309
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,910
放著同樣的爛歌
with the same fucking songs

310
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,240
還他媽的順序播放
in the exact same fucking order.

311
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,460
哦 天啊   怎麼拉
Oh my God.   What

312
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,750
看看誰來了
Look what the bats dragged in.

313
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,590
垃圾仔來這兒做什麼
What the hell is Garbage doing here

314
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,630
哦 見鬼 他過來了
Oh,shit,he's coming over here.

315
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,260
真他媽是個怪胎
What a fucking freak.

316
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,010
夥計們 矜持點 別吵
Guys,be cool. Come on.

317
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,980
嘿   嘿
Hey.   Hey.

318
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,150
你住在我街的對面
You live across the street from me.

319
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,110
嗯
Mm hm.

320
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,110
我叫菲爾
I'm Phil.

321
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,950
我是凱特
I'm Kat.

322
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,580
這是 呃 貝絲和米奇
This is,uh,Beth and Mickey.

323
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,040
嘿
Hey.

324
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,500
這兒看起來超酷
This place seems cool.

325
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,840
嗯
Mm hm.

326
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,130
你經常來嗎
You come here a lot

327
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,970
偶爾吧
Sometimes.

328
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,810
你第一次來這
Is this your first time here

329
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,150
嗯
Uh huh.

330
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,320
我喜歡這首歌
I love this song.

331
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,120
我也是
Me too.

332
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,670
嘿 去跳舞吧
Hey,do you wanna dance

333
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,750
好啊
Sure.

334
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,330
等等 你爸媽回家了怎麼辦
Wait,what if your parents come home

335
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,870
我媽今天去買東西了 我爸在上班
It's my mom's shopping day and my dad's at work.

336
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,850
確定嗎
You sure

337
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,060
確定
Yeah.

338
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,070
哇 對不起 呵呵
Ow. Sorry. Oops.

339
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,660
沒事了
Okay.

340
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,580
你沒事吧
You okay

341
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,590
嗯 啊
Yeah. Okay.

342
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,590
哦 天啊
Oh,God.

343
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,470
就這樣 眨眼工夫 我的童貞沒了
And like that,in a blink,my virginity disappeared.

344
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,100
和老媽一樣
Just like my mother.

345
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:48,690
等等 來了
Hold on. I'm coming.

346
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,280
下午好 希爾曼夫人
Good afternoon,Mrs. Hillman.

347
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,160
我是隔壁的伊芙·康納斯
It's Eve Connors,from next door.

348
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,870
噢 你好
Oh. Hello.

349
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,790
有時間嗎 我可以進來嗎
Do you have a moment May I come in

350
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,750
可以 當然 出什麼事了嗎
Yes,of... of course. ls... is everything all right

351
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,960
沒啥事
Everything's fine.

352
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,550
我就是想跟您隨便聊聊
I just thought we should have a little chat.

353
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,930
請進 隨便坐
Oh,please,sit.

354
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:25,100
您喝茶還是咖啡 康納斯夫人
Can I get you a cup of tea,or coffee,Mrs. Connors

355
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,180
不 不用了 謝謝
No,no thank you.

356
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,520
叫我伊芙就行
And please,call me Eve.

357
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,560
那麼
So...

358
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,150
我能幫你些什麼呢 伊芙
...what can I help you with,Eve

359
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,950
是這樣的 貌似我女兒凱特和你兒子正在約會
Well,it seems my daughter Kat and your son are dating.

360
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:45,330
嗯 我知道 下周他們要去一個大型盛裝舞會
Yeah,I know. They're going to some big fancy dance next week.

361
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:48,370
叫"秋之降臨"   對 就是這個
Fall formal.   Ah,the... that's... that's it.

362
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,170
菲爾 他非常激動
Phil is,he's so excited.

363
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,670
我覺得這可能是個讓你我親近的好機會
I thought it might be a good idea for us to get acquainted,

364
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,750
所以 我想自我介紹一下 我
so I wanted to introduce myself,and...

365
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,710
哇哦
Whoa. Whoops.

366
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,420
菲爾
Phil

367
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,090
抱歉 我不知道有客人
Sorry,I didn't know anyone was here.

368
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,810
菲爾 這是凱特的媽媽 康納斯夫人
Phil,this is Kat's mother,Mrs. Connors.

369
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,720
嘿
Hey.

370
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,190
她來跟咱們打個照面
She just,uh,came by to say hello.

371
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:14,980
呃 好吧
Uh,okay.

372
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,230
那 我先回房間了
Well,I'm just gonna head to my room.

373
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,910
他是個棒小伙
He's a nice boy.

374
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,580
你可以放心 伊芙 我家菲爾
You can rest assured,Eve,that my Phil

375
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,620
會好好待您女兒的
will take good care of your daughter.

376
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:37,840
他借了一套燕尾服 還有其他什麼的
He's rented a tux,and everything.

377
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,130
嗯
Yes.

378
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:45,050
下午我要帶凱特去商場買條新裙子
I'm taking Kat to the mall this afternoon to buy a new dress.

379
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,060
如果你媽媽那麼不開心
if your mother was so unhappy,

380
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,390
你覺得她最初為什麼嫁給你爸爸
why do you think she married your father in the first place

381
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,060
天啊 這我可不知道
God,I have no idea.

382
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:58,730
因為他是真命天子
Because he was there

383
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,320
我是說 他想娶她
I mean,he wanted to marry her.

384
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,860
可能她別無選擇
She had no other choice,maybe

385
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,280
我是說 她去大學做接待員
I mean,she went to college,and she was working as a receptionist,

386
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,410
但她還能做些什麼呢
but what else was she gonna do

387
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,790
我猜和我爸爸一起的生活
I guess life with my father

388
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,630
是非常冰冷而悲傷的
must have been pretty bleak and miserable for her.

389
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,960
那晚她離去前
In the weeks before she left

390
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,010
我注意到她的打扮有了變化
I noticed that she started dressing different.

391
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,970
變化是什麼意思
What do you mean,different

392
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,390
好比說 她的衣服更緊身 更性感了
Like,her clothes got tighter. Sexier.

393
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,640
她甚至買了一條迷你裙
I mean,she even bought a miniskirt.

394
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:37,100
也就是那晚她撞見我和菲爾
Then there was that night that she walked in on me and Phil.

395
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,690
我覺得菲爾該回家了
I think it's time for Phil to go home.

396
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,240
什麼 為什麼   時候不早了
What Why   It's late.

397
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,990
現在才11點多
It's not even midnight.

398
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,740
凱特 照我說的做 我說了你該睡覺了
Kat,what I say goes. And I say go to bed.

399
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,370
最古怪的是 她那件睡衣
The weirdest part was that she had on this nightgown

400
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,120
幾乎是透明的
that was practically see through.

401
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:58,080
就像一個走秀台的模特
It was almost like she was putting on a show.

402
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,380
難道這就是她在做的
Could it be that's what she was doing

403
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,960
啥 走秀
What Putting on a show

404
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,760
秀給我看 還是秀給菲爾看啊
For me,or for Phil

405
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,930
不是的
No.

406
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,390
我覺得她只是空虛寂寞
I think she was just bored.

407
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,640
更年期到了 想盡她所能吸引眼球
And getting older,and trying to get whatever attention she could.

408
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:22,730
簡直就像她要去約會一樣
It was almost like she wanted to have an affair or something.

409
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,950
你認為她要去約會
Do you think that's what was going on

410
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:31,240
不 我的意思 難以想像這種事情
No. I mean,I can't imagine it.

411
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:35,290
但一切皆有可能 不是嗎
But,I guess anything's possible,right

412
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,330
噢 抱歉
Oh. Sorry.

413
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,750
我敲了門 但沒人應
I tried knocking but there was no answer.

414
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,920
沒關係 有什麼要幫忙的嗎
That's all right. Could I help you with something

415
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:49,890
我在找我媽那隻大笨貓
I'm just looking for my mom's stupid cat.

416
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,300
你看到它了嗎
Have you seen him

417
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:55,470
沒看到
Can't say that I have.

418
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,190
好吧 抱歉打擾您了 康納斯夫人
Oh. Okay. Sorry to bother you,Mrs. Connors.

419
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:04,400
康納斯夫人聽起來太見外了 叫我伊芙就行
Mrs. Connors sounds so formal. Call me Eve.

420
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,240
哦 好吧
Oh. All right.

421
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,320
你知道我 跟你們這些年輕人比起來並不顯老
You know,the time when I was your age doesn't seem so far away to me.

422
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,910
我該繼續找我媽的貓了
Well,I should probably look for my mom's cat.

423
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,710
菲爾 今晚跟我們共進晚餐怎麼樣
Phil,would you like to have dinner with us tonight

424
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,210
我做了陽澄湖大閘蟹
I'm making crab thermador.

425
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,800
呃 行
Uh,sure.

426
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,350
7點鐘開飯
Dinner is at seven.

427
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:38,180
酷 謝謝 康納斯夫人 不對
Cool. Thanks,Mrs. Connor. I mean...

428
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,060
伊芙

Leave a message after the beep.

431
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,460
嗨 呃 警官 是我 凱特·康納斯
Hi. Um,Detective. It's,uh,it's Kat Connors.

432
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,510
我打給你 是因為我
I'm just... I'm just calling because I think

433
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:14,140
有一些關於
I might have some information

434
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,600
我媽媽的線索 呃
about my mother. Uh...

435
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,980
嗨 很高興又在這見到你了
Hey. Thanks again for meeting me here.

436
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,310
難以忍受節假日
Couldn't bear the thought of going

437
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,650
去辦公室的感覺 懂吧
into the office on my day off,you know

438
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,070
沒關係
No problem.

439
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,900
進來吧
Come on in.

440
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,700
謝謝
Thank you.

441
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,530
陋室 但總歸是家
It ain't fancy,but it's home.

442
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,040
要喝點什麼嗎   嗯 好啊
Can I get you a drink   Yeah,sure.

443
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,380
本想給你啤酒 不過你還未成年吧
I'd offer you a beer,but you're not of age.

444
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,630
給我一瓶吧
I'd take one anyway.

445
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,630
那好吧
All right then.

446
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,680
隨便坐
Sit down.

447
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,700
喝吧   謝謝
Go on.   Thanks.

448
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:07,170
那麼 有什麼要和我討論的嗎
So What do you want to talk to me about

449
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,130
我
I,um...

450
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,130
我打你電話是因為 我有一些新的發現
I... I called because I have some new information.

451
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,220
我記起一些事情 我覺得
I just remembered some things,and,

452
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,760
我媽可能有外遇
I think my mother may have been having an affair.

453
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:22,350
是嗎
Oh,yeah

454
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:25,810
這應該可以解釋她為什麼會失蹤 是嗎
I mean,it could explain why she left,right

455
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:31,230
也許吧 我週一會做調查
Maybe. I'll look into it on Monday.

456
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,780
好吧
Okay.

457
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,160
就這些
Is that it

458
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,410
我覺得這很可能和案情有關
I just thought that it might be,like,relative to the case.

459
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,250
你很緊張嗎
Are you nervous

460
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:58,380
我覺得有一點點吧
I guess. A little.

461
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:02,430
你想走隨時可以走的 知道嗎
Well,you know you can leave any time you want,right

462
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,310
我知道
I know.

463
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,690
但你還不想走 是不是
But,uh,you don't want to leave,do you.

464
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,070
你就是來勾引我的
Because you came here to seduce me.

465
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:21,740
祝賀你 妹子 你勾引成功了
Well,congratulations,sweetheart. It worked.

466
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,580
我被你誘惑到了
I'm seduced.

467
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,830
你幾歲了
And how old are you

468
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,250
18歲
Eighteen.

469
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,790
你不是處女了吧
You're not a virgin,are you

470
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,670
不是
No.

471
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,220
那麼
So,uh...

472
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,890
你知道接下來會發生什麼吧
...you know what's about to happen,right

473
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,720
你確定這是你想要的
And are you sure that's what you want

474
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:53,520
你知道 我不同於貴校任何一個朋克同學嗎
Because I'm not one of your punk classmates from school,you know

475
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,320
我知道
I know.

476
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,250
好吧 你身材很火辣 這是顯而易見的
Well,you're hot,that's for sure.

477
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,210
你的胸部相當完美
Your tits are perfect.

478
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,210
你自己心知肚明 不是嗎
But you already know that,don't you.

479
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,390
也許我應該和你坐近一點
Maybe I should come over there and join you.

480
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,890
嗯
Yeah.

481
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,780
這樣舒服些了
This better

482
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,360
嗯
Mm hm.

483
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,550
你為什麼不脫掉衣服
Why don't you take this top off,huh

484
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,820
很迷人
Fucking amazing.

485
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,080
想要嗎
Is this what you want

486
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,580
想
Yeah.

487
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,480
嘿   怎麼啦
Hey.   What

488
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,280
你沒事吧
Everything all right

489
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:11,030
沒事 我只是睡不著
Yeah. I just don't sleep so good sometime.

490
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,660
想到了很多糟糕的事情
I've seen a lot of bad shit.

491
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,620
那些死去的人
Dead people.

492
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,630
讓我很不安
Very unhappy about it.

493
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,710
哦 是嗎
Oh yeah

494
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,340
嗯
Yeah.

495
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,630
相信我 都是些可怕的事情
Trust me,you don't wanna know.

496
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,220
說來聽聽
Try me.

497
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,890
好吧
All right.

498
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:41,320
以前 這兒有個胖子
Once there was this obese man,

499
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,240
一群變態往他身上澆滿汽油
some sick fuck had doused him with gasoline

500
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,990
把他活活燒死
and lit him on fire.

501
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,660
兩天後 我們找到
And by the time we got to the body,

502
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,870
他的屍體
two days later,

503
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,380
屍體還在燃燒
he was still burning.

504
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,880
怎麼會這樣
What

505
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,340
他身上太多脂肪了
Guy had so much body fat,

506
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,680
被燒得像一尊人形蠟像一樣
he was like a human candle.

507
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:18,350
在我多年的警察生涯中
And there's one thing I've learned,

508
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,980
我長知識
in all my years as a cop,

509
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:29,650
一個人有可能會對另一個人 做喪心病狂
it's that people are capable of doing horrible,

510
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,700
喪盡天良的壞事
unimaginable things to each other.

511
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,670
喜歡你是如此的狡猾
Love how slippery you are.

512
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,750
感覺我好像會把你折成兩半
Feel like I could break you in half.

513
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,750
我其實還能更厲害的
I'm tougher than I look.

514
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,550
哦 是嗎   哦 是的
Oh,yeah   Oh,yeah.

515
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,970
那再來   好啊
Wanna try me   Yes.

516
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:52,220
哦 天啊
Oh,my God.

517
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,300
這有什麼 小事一樁
What It was easy.

518
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,350
這還算小事
What do you mean it was easy

519
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,680
不就是去和他做愛嗎
I mean I went over there and I fucked him.

520
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:02,400
哇 我對你刮目相看
Wow. I'm impressed.

521
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,650
完全被你打敗了 激情四射嗎
Truly,truly impressed. So was it hot

522
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,610
當然 他比菲爾強太多了
Oh,hell yes. Like,so much better than Phil.

523
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,690
真是個騷貨
Deets,girl,deets.

524
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,240
他真是男人中的極品
He's just,like,so manly.

525
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:16,740
器大活好 胸毛濃密 肌肉發達
Like,cock,and balls,and,like,hairy chest,and muscles,and,

526
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:19,150
還有啊 他身上散發的男子氣息
like,the way he smells,Beth,

527
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,500
那麼野性 那麼原始
is so intense. It's,like,primal.

528
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,790
哦 我現在還能聞到那氣息
Oh,I can still smell him on me now.

529
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,960
快讓我聞聞
Oh,my God,let me smell..

530
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,510
哦 天啊 這味兒老騷了
Oh,God,that's so hot.

531
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,920
我也好想有一天能好爽
One day I hope some musky macho stud

532
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,340
能睡一個肌肉男
will fuck the shit out of me too.

533
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:36,930
很快就會有的   是嗎 什麼時候 什麼時候
Oh,it'll happen.   Oh,yeah. When When

534
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,430
我真是羨慕嫉妒恨啊
I'm so proud of you.

535
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,560
幹嘛 就因為我睡了個老男人
Why Because I fucked an old guy

536
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,150
是啊
Yeah.

537
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,270
我是說 你不該走這條錯路的 凱特
I mean,don't take this the wrong way,Kat,

538
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,860
在很長一段時間內
but for the longest time

539
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,820
你都活在自己的世界裏
you were acting like you were still fat.

540
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,610
不好意思 我不知道你在說什麼
Oh my God. What are you talking about

541
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,160
你這樣會失去生活的重心的
I mean,you lost all of that weight,like,

542
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,160
你忘記了 大概三年前
what,three years ago

543
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,080
你對週遭世界那麼的恐懼和焦慮
But you're still skulking around all angsty and awkward.

544
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,290
跟我一樣像個肥婆
Like a fat chick. Like me.

545
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,880
還有米奇 他外表像瘦彎男其實內心是個肥直婆
And Mickey,who's basically a fat chick in a skinny gay body.

546
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:11,630
你這不扯麼   是大實話
You're crazy.   It's true.

547
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,720
康納你好
Mr. Connor,

548
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,970
我是羅馬琳達警局的雪莉警官
this is Sheryl from the Lorna Linda Police Department.

549
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,680
我們很高興地通知你 你通過了測謊試驗
I'm pleased to inform you that you passed your lie detector test.

550
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:22,310
謝謝你的合作 祝您生活愉快
Thank you for your cooperation,and have a nice day.

551
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,650
你爸幹嘛要去做測謊試驗
Why would your dad need to take a lie detector test

552
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,730
我不知道
I have no idea.

553
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,190
會不會條子覺得你爸知道些什麼
Well,do you think the cops think he knows something

554
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,110
我爸 貝絲 你又不是不認識他
My dad Beth,have you met him

555
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,580
你去字典裏找"燒餅"這個詞 我爸的照片就是註解
Look up clueless in the dictionary and there's a picture of him.

556
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,870
一定是條子查案方式不對
Must be some kind of mistake.

557
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,080
可能吧
Probably.

558
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,420
應該是他的車 你直接去問他吧
I think that's his car. Just ask him.

559
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,630
你趕我走啊   什麼 沒有 說什麼呢
Do you want me to leave   What No. Whatever.

560
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,010
我開玩笑的
I'm sure it's nothing.

561
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:56,590
嗨 親愛的 貝絲
Hi,sweetheart,Beth.

562
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,060
兩位大美人 在超市沒花太多錢吧
Kids didn't spend too much money at the mall,I hope

563
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,350
沒有 只買了一點點東西
Nope. I just picked up a few things.

564
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,560
爸爸 剛才有條
Hey,dad,there was a,uh,message for you,

565
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:12,360
電話留言 是警局打來的
on the machine,from the police department.

566
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,070
是關於媽媽的消息嗎
Is there news about your mother

567
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,620
不是 他們說你通過了測謊試驗
No. They said that you passed the lie detector test

568
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,660
哦 甚妙
Oh. Well,whoop dee do.

569
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,580
那貝絲留下一塊吃飯吧
So,you going to join us for dinner,Beth

570
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,830
不了 我得回去了 康叔
I... I don't think so,Mr. Connors.

571
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,830
嗯
Hm.

572
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,040
爸 警察為什麼讓你去測謊
Dad,why would they want you to take a lie detector test

573
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:33,510
我也不知道 大概是查案標準程序吧
Beats me. It's standard procedure in cases like this,I guess.

574
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,510
晚飯怎麼說 親愛的
So what are you feeling,sweetheart

575
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,930
要不還是叫外賣吧
Should we order takeout from that rib place

576
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,100
嗯 行啊
Yeah,sure.

577
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,690
媽媽
Mom

578
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,950
怎麼了 有什麼事嗎
What is it What's going on

579
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,290
菲爾的功夫不錯
Is Phil a good fuck

580
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,960
好去睡了 媽媽
Go to bed,mom.

581
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,040
不准背對著我
Don't you turn your back on me

582
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,500
我說真的 你趕緊回去睡覺吧
Seriously,just go back to bed.

583
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:15,210
別給臉不要臉
I will not be dismissed by the likes of you.

584
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,130
回答我   哎喲
Answer me   Ow

585
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,340
菲爾的床功很好嗎
Is Phil a good fuck

586
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,930
什麼玩意兒床功 你到底想問什麼
What would you know about fucking,anyway

587
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,310
幹嘛啊你
Oh my... what are you doing

588
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,020
這算什麼
What is this

589
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,730
媽媽 你要幹嘛   你為什麼不穿衣服
Mom,what are you...   Why are you naked

590
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:33,190
我熱啊 真是的 你出去
I was hot Jesus Get out of my room

591
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,730
你為什麼要這樣
Why are you doing this

592
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,070
我做錯什麼了我 住手
What did I ever do to you Stop

593
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:42,410
我太知道了
I do too know what a good fuck is.

594
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,240
你個小賤人
You little slut.

595
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:50,710
有病啊你
What is your problem

596
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:55,380
吃錯藥啦 你神經病沒好轉
Are you insane What is fucking wrong with you

597
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,890
哪個當媽的會對女兒做這種事
What kind of mother would do something like that

598
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,190
我媽
My mother.

599
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:16,110
怎麼了 幹嘛 她就是那樣對我的
What What That's just how she was.

600
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:18,900
每個人都有童年陰影
I mean,everyone has a crappy childhood.

601
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,320
但她這種和打罵體罰不一樣
It's not like she beat me.

602
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:23,020
所以我媽媽並不是完美無缺的模範母親
So my mom wasn't Hallmark Card perfect.

603
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,700
你有什麼好驚訝的
So fucking what

604
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,080
我覺得她很孤獨
I just think she was lonely.

605
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:36,460
有好幾次我發現她死盯著我的衣服看
I used to catch her staring at me,

606
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:40,300
搞得好像衣服是我從她那偷來的一樣
like I was wearing something that I had stolen from her.

607
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:45,050
很像當年的我
You look like I looked when I was you.

608
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,890
什麼
What

609
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:50,980
我是說 我當年和你現在一樣
I mean,you look like I looked when I was your age.

610
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,480
隨便你怎麼說 偷窺狂
Whatever,lurker.

611
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,320
幹嘛 你要幹嘛
What What do you want

612
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,490
沒什麼
Nothing.

613
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:06,620
哦 天啊 別盯著我看了 你的眼神太嚇人
Oh my God,stop gawking at me. You're creeping me out.

614
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,830
你走開 離我遠點
Just,like,get out of here. Just leave me alone.

615
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,340
大概一周前 她突然失蹤了
About a week before she disappeared,

616
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:25,090
那時我和菲爾在地下室做作業
Phil and I were in the basement doing homework,

617
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:28,220
就跟平常的夜晚一樣
just like any other ordinary night.

618
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,150
怎樣 覺得如何 你喜歡嗎
Well,what do you think You like

619
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:38,060
42歲依然風韻猶存 嗯哼
Pretty sexy for 42,huh

620
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:39,610
媽媽 你在幹什麼
Mom,what are you doing

621
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:43,150
哦 別緊張 一本正經小姐
Oh,loosen up,Miss Prissypants.

622
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:48,030
菲爾 你和你媽來我家一塊吃晚飯吧
Phil. Why don't you and your mother join us for dinner

623
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,240
我在做世界上最好吃的惠靈頓牛肉
I'm making my world famous Beef Wellington.

624
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:55,250
呃 好啊 康夫人 我會問我媽的
Uh,yeah,o... okay,Mrs. Connors. I'll ask.

625
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,080
甚妙
Splendid.

626
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:01,590
我打算狂慶祝
I'm in the mood for celebrating.

627
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,720
好了 媽 我們知道了 行了吧
Okay,mom,whatever. We get it already.

628
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,640
哦 怎麼了 凱特
Oh,what's the matter,Kat

629
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,350
難道你不能忍受媽媽的愛好略有改變
Can't stand seeing your mother have a little fun for a change

630
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,640
寶貝 我回來了
Honey,I'm home

631
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:18,980
哦 派對剛剛開始就結束了
Oh,and the party is over before it's even begun.

632
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:21,360
親愛的 你在哪
Sweetheart,where are you

633
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,490
你們在這啊 晚餐吃啥
There you are. What's for dinner

634
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:29,450
怎麼回事 你怎麼穿這個鳥樣
What's going on Why are you dressed like that

635
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,080
咋了 你不喜歡這樣
What You don't like it

636
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,990
沒說不喜歡
No. I don't.

637
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,910
瞧 緊身的 你不喜歡這裙子
Well,tough shit. You don't like this skirt

638
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,960
伊芙 別搞了   我不管
Eve,stop it.   I don't care.

639
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,830
我不管你喜不喜歡 反正跟你沒有什麼關係
You don't like this skirt and I don't care.

640
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,500
我不管你喜不喜歡
You don't like this skirt and I don't...

641
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:44,300
把你的臭爪挪開
Get your goddamned hands off me

642
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:49,890
我想穿什麼就穿什麼 無論何時心中一樣親
I'll wear whatever the hell I want. Whenever I want to

643
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:51,680
你在做什麼
What are you doing

644
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:54,430
我他媽的人生 每一個他媽的夜晚
What I do every fucking night of my fucking life,

645
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,890
都在給你們做他媽的晚飯
making your fucking dinner.

646
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:03,530
哦 說什麼呢   哦 什麼臭味
Oh,Jesus   Oh,shit What reeks

647
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,990
那肉 都腐爛了
The meat. It's all rotten.

648
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:07,570
一定是冰櫃插頭鬆了
Must have come unplugged.

649
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,700
別愣在那 快把插頭插上
Don't just stand there,plug it back in

650
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,870
這味就跟他媽的死人味一樣
Smells like a fucking dead body in here

651
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:25,760
看樣子我們得出去搓一頓了
Well,looks like we're going out for dinner tonight.

652
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,630
想吃中餐不
Wanna get Chinese

653
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,800
不 我才不要吃中餐
No. I don't want fucking Chinese.

654
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,180
好吧 那你喜歡吃什麼 伊芙 你要什麼
Okay,then,what would make you happy,Evie What do you want

655
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,100
我不要
I don't want this.

656
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:44,520
我什麼也不要
I don't want any of it.

657
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:48,110
你 還有這房子
You,this house.

658
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,650
伊芙
Evie.

659
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:52,870
我只想要回以前的生活
I want my fucking life back.

660
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,660
別 親愛的 咱下館子去
Come on,sweetheart. Let's go to dinner.

661
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:01,370
都說了我不想吃飯
I don't want fucking dinner

662
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:05,210
為什麼就沒人聽我說話
Why won't anyone listen to me

663
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,580
所以說她就這麼突然 人間蒸發了
So out of the blue she was just,like,poof

664
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:50,670
1991年      春

665
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,330
差不多
Pretty much.

666
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:48,630
你之前說你媽走了 原來是這個意思
You told me your mom left,but not like that.

667
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,880
我們做室友差不多一年了 所以
Well,we've been roommates for almost a year,so.

668
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:54,180
但是你不想找到她麼
But don't you wonder where she is

669
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,890
我是說 她應該就在某個地方 是吧
I mean,she's gotta be somewhere,right

670
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:57,970
我不知道 這太奇怪了
I don't know,it's weird.

671
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,100
現在幾乎都不怎麼想她的事了
Hardly even think about her anymore.

672
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,520
你知道 這麼多的時間已經過去了
You know,it's,like,so much time has passed,

673
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,900
我已經習慣了
that kinda just gotten used to it.

674
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,730
估計下周回家休息一下
Guess going home next week for break

675
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,780
過去 那幽靈一直在我眼前驅之不去
has kinda resurrected the ghost from my past.

676
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:14,110
說到幽靈 你不會想去見
Speaking of ghosts,you're not gonna go see

677
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,490
你那屌絲前男友吧 叫什麼來著
that loser boyfriend of yours,what's his name,are you

678
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,080
你是說菲爾
You mean Phil

679
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,870
也許吧 怎麼說
Maybe. Why

680
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,380
你知道我是力挺奧利佛的
Well,you know I'm team Oliver.

681
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,460
我跟奧利佛才好了幾個月
We've only been dating for a couple of months.

682
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:29,880
所以啊 足夠瞭解到他熱火又聰明
So That's enough to know that he's hot,and smart,

683
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,970
新時代的有為青年 不像那個叫什麼來著
and actually has a future,unlike what's his name.

684
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:36,180
辛迪 你只見過菲爾一面 上次週末的時候
Cindy,you met Phil once,for a weekend.

685
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,550
是啊 我看一眼就鑒定完畢
Yeah,that was enough.

686
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,810
不管怎樣 以後有的煩了
Whatever. The future bores me.

687
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,980
你還好嗎 沒啥事吧
What's going on with you tonight ls everything okay

688
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,400
很好啊 怎麼了
Yeah,why

689
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:52,030
不知道怎麼說 感覺你身在曹營心在漢
I don't know,you seem a million miles away.

690
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:56,780
不好意思 只是有一點心事
Sorry. Just a little preoccupied.

691
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,660
我沒事
I'm fine.

692
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,330
怎麼
What

693
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,790
沒怎麼
Nothing.

694
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,590
有話就說 別老說沒事
Don't say nothing when it's something.

695
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,840
好吧 你知道我不喜歡你抽煙
Okay,you know I don't like it when you smoke.

696
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,010
有害健康 而且你還在吃毓婷
It's bad for you,especially since you're on the pill.

697
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:15,970
好吧 這根只是今天的第2根
Yeah,well,this is only my second one today.

698
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:17,680
我會為了你戒煙的
I'm cutting back,just for you.

699
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:21,890
不是為我 懂嗎 是為你的身體健康
Don't cut back for me. Okay It's your health we're talking about.

700
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,650
好吧 大夫
Okay,doctor.

701
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,020
你滿意了沒
Are you satisfied

702
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,780
只要你不犯傻 我就滿意
Not if you're gonna be mad.

703
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,900
為什麼我會犯傻 嗯
Why would I be mad Hm

704
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,900
就因為要你教我怎麼做人嗎
Just because you're telling me what to do

705
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:39,240
我在宿舍不能抽煙 因為辛迪說煙味難聞
I mean,I can't smoke in my room because Cindy says it stinks,

706
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:41,580
我在男朋友身邊也不能抽煙 因為他說抽煙不健康
and I can't smoke around you because you say it's unhealthy.

707
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,200
凱特 其實你應該沒有尼古丁上癮
Kat,it's not like you're addicted to nicotine.

708
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:44,500
你才抽了兩個月
You've been smoking for two months.

709
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:47,580
夠啦 不管怎樣 我想做什麼就做什麼
Okay,well,whatever. I just want to be free to do what I want.

710
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,790
好吧 你抽吧 抽吧
Okay,fine. Go ahead and smoke.

711
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,840
我不想吵架
I don't want to fight.

712
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:59,180
好了 我錯了 行不
Look,I'm sorry,okay

713
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,180
我只是 我只是想你開開心心
I just... I want you to be happy.

714
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,770
我回家了   等等 怎麼啦
I think I'm just gonna head home.   Wait. What

715
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:07,940
我要走了 我要去做作業
I'm going. I have studying to do.

716
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,400
凱特 好了啦 你這是 這是幹嘛 別走
Kat,come on. What are... what are you doing Just stay.

717
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,480
晚安 奧利佛
Goodnight,Oliver.

718
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:17,150
天啊 你到底怎地了 玩真的
Oh my God,what is the matter with you Seriously

719
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,320
我做錯什麼了 凱特 凱特
What did I do Kat Kat

720
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,110
嘿 嗨 老爸
Hey Hi,dad.

721
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,280
哇
Wow.

722
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,740
怎麼了
What

723
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:04,580
真不敢相信 我女兒這麼漂亮了
I can't believe how grown up you look.

724
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,750
什麼呀 請你不要拍這種馬屁好嗎
Oh,God. Can we forego the theatrics,please

725
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:11,500
別嫌老爸肉麻 我想死我小乖乖了
Whatever. Act as jaded as you want,I missed my little girl

726
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,710
我想念你在心 口不難開
and I'm not ashamed to say so.

727
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,670
在伯克利大學讀得怎樣
So how is Berkeley

728
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:15,840
對了 謝謝你的信 老爸每封都看了
Thanks for all the letters,by the way.

729
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,380
哦 對不起 最近忙著看書忘了寫信
Oh,sorry. Been studying my ass off.

730
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:18,590
我明白 我明白
I know,I know.

731
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,230
你現在是混大城市的姑娘了
You're a big city girl now.

732
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:21,840
當然沒時間留給我這窮老爸
No time for your poor old dad.

733
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:26,600
歡迎你回家 親愛的
I'm glad you're home,sweetheart.

734
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:33,350
呃 我們是不是先
Uh,sh... should we

735
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,440
哦 對 你放著罷 我來拿
Yes. No,I got it. I got it. Ugh.

736
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:38,320
謝謝   走吧
Thank you.   Here.

737
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,110
這邊有啥子新聞或好玩的事
So,anything new and exciting around here

738
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:44,370
沒什麼 還是老樣子 沒啥大變化
Oh,not really. Much the same old,same old.

739
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:45,870
怎麼了
What

740
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,740
爸爸
Dad

741
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,920
爸爸 你怎麼了 好像有點心神不寧
Dad,what is it Why are you acting all weird

742
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,130
沒什麼 只是有那麼一件小事
Well,I do have a bit of news.

743
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:57,210
沒事吧
Is everything okay

744
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,920
沒啥大不了 只是 呃
Everything's fine. I just,um...

745
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,510
哦 天啊 別吞吞吐吐的
Oh my God,just spit it out already.

746
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,140
我 身邊多了一個人
I've been seeing someone.

747
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,310
真的啊   嗯 你不會生我氣吧
Really   Yes. Does it make you angry

748
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:10,390
怎麼會呢 開什麼玩笑
What Are you kidding me

749
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:11,730
沒事啦 爸爸 媽媽都不在這麼久了
No,dad,mom's been gone

750
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:14,060
你找其他女人這很正常啊
a long time. Why shouldn't you see other women

751
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:17,690
嗯 那好
Well,good.

752
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,690
那麼 她叫什麼名字
So,what's her name

753
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,400
梅   梅
May.   May

754
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:23,650
她是個推銷員 我在辦公室認識她的
She's a sales rep I met at the office.

755
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:26,330
爸爸 實在太好了
Dad,that's so great.

756
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:28,740
說心裏話 我真替你高興
Seriously,I'm really happy for you.

757
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:31,200
謝謝 寶貝 這對我而言很重要
Thank you,sweetheart. That means a lot to me.

758
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:35,580
那你準備在家幹些什麼
So,what are your plans while you're at home

759
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:37,710
呃 有些課題要研究一下
Uh,I have some studying to do,

760
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,550
不過 最主要我想歇歇
but mostly I just wanna relax,

761
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:45,640
去看看老朋友們 你認識的 以前那幾個
see some old friends. You know,the usual.

762
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,060
哇哦 稀客來了 歡迎
Wow. Welcome back,stranger.

763
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:55,690
好你個拋棄死黨的學霸
Such a fucking rebel.

764
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:57,690
凱特 你是我的新偶像
Kat,you're my new idol.

765
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:02,030
天啊 我想死你們了
Oh,my God,I've missed you guys.

766
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:04,150
我是說 我在伯克利的朋友都很好
I mean,my friends at Berkley are nice and everything,

767
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,860
就是有點無聊
but just kind of boring.

768
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:08,200
哦 我也好想你啊
Oh,I missed you too.

769
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,330
這鳥不拉屎的鄉下地方 我都呆膩了
What I haven't missed is this shitty little pisshole of a town.

770
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:13,700
哦 剛才早上 我老媽還叫我把屋子收拾乾淨
Oh my God,my mom told me to clean my room this morning.

771
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:15,710
我真想錘死她
I almost bludgeoned her to death.

772
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:17,500
呃 真難想像我們曾在這生活
Ugh,I can't believe we ever lived here.

773
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:19,130
我懂
Oh,I know.

774
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:22,170
不過有一點比較安逸 這小鎮一直沒變
Though I kind of find it reassuring that this place never changes.

775
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:25,050
懂我意思嗎 就好像時間被凍結了一樣
You know It's like it's frozen in time.

776
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,470
你覺得你變了
And you think you've changed

777
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,850
啊 是 我是這麼說過
Oh,yeah. I'd say so.

778
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,100
我是說 以自己的本來面目生活更好過些
I mean,I definitely feel more comfortable in my own skin.

779
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:38,190
在學校都還好吧   嗯
School's going well   Mm hm.

780
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:43,480
你還是沒你媽媽的消息
And I assume you haven't heard from your mother.

781
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:45,570
沒 杳無音訊
Nope. Not a word.

782
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:48,700
你有什麼感受嗎 這都已經兩年了
How are you feeling about that It's been over two years.

783
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:50,910
我 我不知道
I... I don't know.

784
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,620
這 這麼說吧 我已經不抱什麼希望了
It's... it's kind of gotten to the point where

785
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,410
我已經對這事失去信心了
I just don't even expect to hear from her anymore.

786
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:00,790
我就是習慣了這種詭異的現狀
I've just come to this weird sort of acceptance of it.

787
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,000
我覺得我可能才剛開始習慣
Guess I've just moved on.

788
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:07,130
我是說 甚至連我爸都給自己找了個新女友
I mean,even my dad has himself a new girlfriend.

789
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,640
這件事令你不安嗎
Does that bother you at all

790
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,310
沒有啊 為什麼這麼問
Hm mm. Why should it

791
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:15,430
我媽走了 不可能再回來了
My mother's gone. She's never coming back.

792
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:32,870
嗨
Hey.

793
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,580

796
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,050
嗨 亞倫 我可以抽會兒煙嗎

797
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:53,140

Come on.

799
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,060
在學校還算好
So school's going good

800
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:04,360
還好 你呢 你過得咋樣
It's all right. How about you How've you been

801
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:10,200
你知道的 除了幹活就是照顧老媽
You know,work,taking care of my mom.

802
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,990
還是老一套
Same old,same old.

803
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,990
她還好吧   我媽
How is she   My mom

804
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,040
嗯
Yeah.

805
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,120
還是瘋婆子一個
Batshit crazy as ever.

806
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:27,510
給我一根唄
Can I have one

807
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:33,470
好啊 你也抽煙了
Sure. You're smoking now

808
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,970
偶爾吧 謝了
Sometimes. Thanks.

809
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:49,150
啥時候回來的

821
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,280
看我
See me.

822
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:41,410
我是說 你不用浪費寶貴時間來看我這種渣渣
I mean,I know you might not have time for an asshole like me,

823
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:44,960
你可是名牌大學高材生
now that you're a hot shit college student.

824
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,750
菲爾 你說什麼呢
Phil,what are you talking about

825
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,340
我當然想見你
Of course I want to see you.

826
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,130
嗯 好吧
Right,whatever.

827
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:58,300
我得回去幹活了 我老闆脾氣大得很
I better get back to work before my boss has a cow.

828
00:57:58,470 --> 00:57:59,720
好
Yeah.

829
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:15,400
很抱歉我來晚了 路上堵的不成樣子
I am so sorry that I'm late. Traffic was ridiculous.

830

I'm so happy we finally get the chance to meet.

833
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,620
我之前有聽過關於你的很多事
I've heard so much about you.

834
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:28,080
噢 我也是 呵呵
Oh,me too.hehe

835
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:30,590
你真人比你爸描述的更可愛
And you're even lovelier than your father described.

836
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,300
噢 沒這麼誇張吧
Oh. I'm sure that's not true,

837
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:33,630
不過還是謝謝誇獎
but thank you anyway.

838
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,970
這次回家要休息幾天 凱特麗娜
So how long will you be in town,Katrina

839
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:39,850
哦 就一周而已 然後就回學校
Oh,just a week. Then it's back to the salt mines.

840
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:42,140
凱特第一學期成績可是全優哦
Kat got almost all "A"s her first semester.

841
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,350
哇哦 恭喜恭喜
Wow,congratulations.

842
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:48,190
是啊 很走運 你們點菜了沒 我快餓死了
Yeah. I lucked out. Have you guys ordered yet I'm starved.

843
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:49,980
你的最愛 菠菜洋薊開胃菜
Your favorite,the spinach artichoke appetizer.

844
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:52,440
已經在做了   哦 太好了
It's already on its way.   Oh,yes.

845
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:54,440
我得去趟洗手間
I'm going to make a quick trip to the ladies room.

846
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:56,570
等會服務員來了 你知道我要點什麼的
If the waiter comes,you know what I want.

847
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,490
好 去吧
Right,okay.

848
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,960
那麼 你覺得怎樣
So,uh,are you all right with this

849
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:14,090
什麼 你說梅阿姨嗎
What You mean May

850
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:17,220
好吧 爸爸 我喜歡她 她看上去挺親切的
Yeah,Dad I like her. She seems sweet.

851
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,220
我不想讓你感到尷尬
I just don't want it to be awkward for you.

852
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:21,890
爸爸 我跟你說過了 你找新女友我很高興
Dad,I told you I am thrilled that you met someone.

853
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:24,470
說真的 你理應得到幸福
Seriously,you deserve to be happy.

854
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:32,190
摘下婚戒吧
Took off your wedding ring.

855
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,280
這東西會讓梅不好受
It makes May uncomfortable.

856
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:41,410
我是在她不在的時候重新戴上的
I put it back on when she's not around.

857
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:44,160
何必如此 是媽媽拋棄了我們
Why bother I mean,mom left us.

858
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,540
是她自己作出的選擇 我已經接受這點了
She's the one who made that choice. I accept that now.

859
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:51,380
是時候開始我們的新生活了
It's about time we get on with our lives.

860
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,510
媽媽
Mom

861
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,730
凱特
Kat.

862
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,650
怎麼了 出什麼事了
What is it What's wrong

863
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:17,990
我把手放進水裏 結果手不見了
I put my hands in the water,and they disappeared.

864
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:20,490
什麼
What

865
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:27,200
我在洗碗 這水太涼了
I was doing the dishes and the water was so cold.

866
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:30,000
水槽底下有個勺子
There was a spoon at the bottom of the sink,

867
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:35,210
當我把手從水裏拿出來時
and when I lifted my hands out of the water...

868
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:49,730
怎麼了
What's the matter

869
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:51,850
呃 沒啥
Um,nothing.

870
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,860
有時會做奇怪的夢
Just have strange dreams sometimes.

871
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:01,400
是麼
Oh yeah

872
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:03,570
是的
Yeah.

873
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:07,530
自從我媽失蹤後開始做那種怪夢
They started after my mother disappeared.

874
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,750
以前一直做
Used to get them all the time.

875
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:13,580
最近幾周來還是第一次
It's actually the first one I've had in weeks.

876
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:16,710
很少聽你談起你母親
You hardly ever talk about your mother.

877
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,800
沒什麼好談的 她都走了
There's not much to say. She's gone.

878
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:24,720
那個心理醫生說夢是毫無意義的
The shrink says dreams are meaningless.

879
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,560
我不敢茍同
I don't think I agree with that.

880
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:33,480
我做的這些夢 你怎麼看
What do you think my dreams mean

881
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:45,780
你真的想知道
You really want my opinion

882
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:47,910
當然了 你說嘛
Of course. Why wouldn't I

883
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,880
你知道 我們盡全力仔細找過你的母親
As you know,we did an exhaustive search for your mother.

884
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:00,380
仔細 你們連灰都找不到
Exhaustive You guys barely even looked for her.

885
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:04,090
實際上 我們做了一個徹底的調查
Actually,a very thorough investigation was done.

886
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,680
為了找你母親 我們花了超過兩年的時間
We spent over two years looking for your mom.

887
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,760
但一點線索都沒有
Not a single trace was ever found.

888
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:13,020
嗯哼 無所謂了
Mm hm. Whatever.

889
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:16,980
你覺得她現在在哪兒
So where do you think she is

890
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:22,610
我覺得她死了
I think she's dead.

891
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,530
什麼
What

892
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,700
上次你跟我說她有外遇
Well,you said yourself she was having an affair,

893
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:32,700
這點我們證實了
which we confirmed.

894
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:35,500
還有你的鄰居也這麼說 好像是叫布朗曼夫人
With your neighbor,Mrs. Blangman

895
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:38,420
是希爾曼夫人
Mrs. Hillman.

896
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:42,920
反正就是她 說你母親搞了個小三
Whatever. She said your mom had a boyfriend.

897
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,260
她怎麼知道的
How would she know

898
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:46,880
她很八卦
She's nosy.

899
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:48,970
她是個瞎子
She can't see.

900
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:56,100
等一下 就算我媽搞小三
Wait... whatever. Even if my mom did have a boyfriend,

901
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:58,190
那也不至於跑到一個
doesn't it just make it that much more likely

902
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:00,440
誰也找不到的地方吧
that she just ran off somewhere

903
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:07,280
怎麼了
What

904
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:10,820
怎麼了 說話啊 你怎麼不說話了
What What is it What aren't you saying

905
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:16,000
我們對你父親的背景做了一個全面調查
We did a thorough background check on your father.

906
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,420
一些被調查者告知我們
Several interviewees told us

907
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:23,210
你父親是一個暴力且易妒的人
that he was a pretty jealous and volatile man.

908
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:26,170
我爸就是一個膽小鬼
My dad is a fucking wimp.

909
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,300
所以他才會常常令我媽感到厭煩
That's why he used to drive my mom crazy.

910
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:30,890
這跟鮑勃·卡爾森和瑪吉·卡爾森的描述不符
Not according to Bob and Margie Carlsen.

911
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:33,140
這倆貨又是誰   你家以前的鄰居
Who are they   Your former neighbors.

912
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:36,310
住在河畔 你父母曾住在他們家隔壁
Your parents used to live next door to them in Riverside.

913
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,900
他們向我們透露 你父親總是懷疑你母親
They told us that when your father suspected your mother

914
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:42,400
與鮑勃·卡爾森有染
had a thing for Bob Carlsen,

915
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,980
所以他點燃了一個垃圾桶
he lit a trash can on fire

916
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:47,820
扔到卡爾森家的後院裏
and he tossed it onto their patio.

917
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:52,120
瞎說
That's ridiculous.

918
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:59,160
從來沒聽說過有這號人 再說那是二十年前的事了
Never even heard of these people,and that was two decades ago.

919
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:03,130
好吧 就算我爸真的那麼危險
Fine,if my dad was so dangerous,

920
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:05,800
你們幹嘛不逮捕他
then why didn't you ever arrest him

921
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,470
沒有證據
No evidence.

922
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:11,720
我們甚至找不出足夠理由申請搜查證
We didn't even have sufficient cause for a search warrant.

923
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:16,060
如果你想聽聽我的專業推理 我會告訴你
Asked for my professional opinion,and I told you.

924
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:19,430
凱特 我是這麼想的
Kat,that's just what I think.

925
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:20,890
你說
Which is

926
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:25,070
我認為你母親和小三被你父親捉姦在床
I think you father caught your mother

927
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:27,530
你父親殺了她
fucking her boyfriend and he killed her.

928
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:31,280
那他怎麼處理屍體
Well,then what did he do with the body

929
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,330
那就是一個未解之謎了
That's a damn mystery.

930
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:53,300
凱特 拜託
Kat. Come on.

931
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:54,930
你要去哪兒
Where are you going

932
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,140
警官 你知道我怎麼想的嗎
You know what I think,Detective

933
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:01,020
你真的是名副其實的狗屁警官
I think you're full of shit.

934
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,790
再來啊 猛男 你可以做得更好的
Come on,strong man. You can do better than that.

935
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,460
怎麼弄 就像這樣
What,like this

936
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:25,540
不 用點力
No. Harder.

937
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:30,630
好好用用這身肌肉 這就對了
Put those muscles to good use for a change. That's better.

938
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,890
就是這樣 繼續 來個重拳
That's it. Come on,give it a whack.

939
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,520
你已經到了
You're already here

940
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:47,110
呃 是啊 我在幫你媽媽做飯呢
Uh,yeah. I was just helping your mom with dinner.

941
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:49,190
不像某些人
Unlike some people.

942
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:09,540
嗨 希夫人 是我 凱特 不好意思 你休息了嗎
Hi,Mrs. Hillman. It's Kat. I'm sorry,were you in bed

943
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:12,920
哦 沒 我 我剛躺下
Oh,oh no. I... I was just lying down.

944
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:15,880
我 我身體感覺不太好
I... I haven't been feeling well.

945
01:06:16,050 --> 01:06:18,800
哦 很抱歉打擾您 呃 菲爾在麼
Oh. Well,I'm sorry to bother you. But,uh,is Phil here

946
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:21,060
不 他不在
No. He isn't.

947
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:24,020
那您知道他在哪兒嗎   不清楚啊
Do you know where he is   I'm afraid not.

948
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,520
這小子有時候喜歡出去閒逛
That boy sometimes goes out gallivanting

949
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:29,650
玩到很晚才回來
'til all hours of the night.

950
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:32,280
好吧 他回來的時候叫他給我打個電話好嗎
Okay,well,could you please tell him to call me as soon as he gets home

951
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:35,150
我有要緊事找他   嗯 我知道了
It's kind of important.   Uh... of course.

952
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,700
謝謝 再次抱歉打攪您休息
Thank you. Sorry again for bothering you.

953
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:42,200
哦 沒沒什麼 晚安 親愛的
Oh,it's... it's no problem. Goodnight,dear.

954
01:06:42,370 --> 01:06:43,950
晚安
Good night.

955
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:05,890
我覺得這不合適吧
I don't think it's right with her here.

956
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,890
但是如果凱特說她沒問題的話
But if Kat says she's comfortable,I don't...

957
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:11,310
關鍵不是凱特怎麼說
I don't care what Kat said.

958
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,150
爸爸
Dad

959
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:16,400
寶貝 噢 對不起
Honey Aww,I'm sorry.

960
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:18,450
我沒想吵醒你
I didn't mean to wake you.

961
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:20,780
你是不是在跟梅阿姨爭論她能否在這過夜
If you two are arguing over whether or not

962
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:23,790
我反正沒意見的
May can sleep over,it's totally fine.

963
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:25,410
寶貝 我覺得吧
Sweetheart,I don't think...

964
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:27,960
不 不 爸爸 真的沒關係 我不介意
No,no,no,dad,seriously. I don't mind.

965
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:31,540
你太累了 明天還得送你去機場
Well,you're sick,and we have to get you to the airport tomorrow.

966
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:35,960
我好多了 而且我的航班是下午的
I'm almost better. My flight's not until the afternoon.

967
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:39,380
總之我是一家之主 這裏我說了算
You know what,this is my house and I call the shots around here.

968
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:48,020
抱歉 凱特
Sorry,Kat.

969
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:50,980
我不是故意把你牽扯進來
I didn't mean for you to get dragged into this.

970
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,700
敬菲爾 祝他死無全屍
To Phil,may he rest in pieces.

971
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:01,910
哦 天啊
Oh,my God,

972
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,080
不 去幹菲爾 干他
No,fuck Phil. Seriously,fuck him.

973
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,330
那蠢貨都沒回我電話
The jerk never even called me back.

974
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,170
客觀 去幹菲爾
That's the spirit. Fuck Phil.

975
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:14,710
或者 反一反 不干他了 不干菲爾了
Or,rather,don't fuck Phil. Stop fucking Phil.

976
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,380
對 嗷
Yeah. Oh

977
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:18,800
不如操那個風騷的條子
Fuck that hot stud cop instead.

978
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:21,090
一次又一次
Done and done.

979
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:25,390
你們知道嗎 他前天晚上說了些怪話
You know,he said something kind of weird the other night.

980
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,720
他說什麼了
What'd he say

981
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:29,430
"我要幹得你兩腳發軟"
"I'm gonna plow you 'til you can't walk straight"

982
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:35,820
沒有 呃 他說
No. Um,yeah,it was so...

983
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:40,530
他說他覺得我爸殺了我媽
He said that he thinks my dad killed my mother.

984
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:46,580
怎麼說
What

985
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:50,750
說話呀
What

986
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:56,920
我 我幾年前跟你說過的 凱特
I... I told you that,Kat. Ages ago.

987
01:08:57,090 --> 01:08:58,300
我們都跟你說過
We both did.

988
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:00,590
你倆說啥呢
What are you talking about

989
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,970
那時候你媽媽剛失蹤
It was right after your mom disappeared,

990
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:05,640
你好像不樂意聽那些
and you just didn't seem to want to hear it.

991
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:09,850
記得嗎 我懷疑你老爸是不是在隱瞞什麼
Remember I asked if maybe your dad had something to hide

992
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,430
你否決了
You just blew it off.

993
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,310
你說他那麼透明 怎麼會藏得住什麼
You said he was too transparent to hide anything.

994
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:21,190
你倆瘋了
You guys are fucking crazy.

995
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:26,030
好吧 當我們沒說
Yeah. Forget it.

996
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,490
我倆看了太多懸疑片
We both watch way too much bad TV.

997
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:30,790
但這也是我們仨在一起的原因 不是嗎
But that's why you love us,right

998
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:34,920
呃 天啊
Ugh. God,

999
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,840
再沒有比又熱又不夠勁的香檳更噁心了
there's nothing more disgusting than warm,flat champagne.

1000
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,960
把那個給我   什麼
Here,give me that.   What

1001
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:42,090
瓶子 謝謝
The bottle,please.

1002
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,260
你要幹嘛
What are you doing

1003
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:48,350
這是個學校裏學的把戲
It's a trick I learned at school.

1004
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:50,810
把瓶子放在冰櫃幾分鐘
You put the bottle in the freezer for a few minutes,

1005
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:54,690
它就冰得完美了 過來幫我
and it is chilled to perfection. Come and help me.

1006
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:07,030
米奇   讓我去搬那些舊到發霉的報紙
Mickey   There's no way that I am moving

1007
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,580
甭想 門兒都沒有
a bunch of old,moldy newspapers. Fuck that.

1008
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:13,500
你個皮包骨的基佬 快過來
Get your skinny gay ass over here.

1009
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:16,170
呃
Unh.

1010
01:10:16,330 --> 01:10:18,460
拿走
Get that one.

1011
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:27,760
卡住了
It's stuck.

1012
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:29,470
怎麼回事
What the...

1013
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:34,680
為什麼給一個冰櫃上鎖
Why would you lock a fucking freezer

1014
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:37,400
你們在樓下搞什麼呢
What the hell is going on down here

1015
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:41,940
沒什麼 我們在聊天 喝香檳
Nothing. We're just talking,and drinking champagne.

1016
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:47,280
你朋友該走人了
Well,it's time for your friends to leave.

1017
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:50,080
你說什麼
What are you talking about

1018
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,120
你聽到了 凱特 我說 派對到此結束
You heard me,Kat. The party is over.

1019
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,580
你開玩笑嗎
Are you joking

1020
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:57,210
爸 不是我存心頂撞你 可我已經是成年人了
Dad,I hate to break it to you,but I'm a fuckin' adult.

1021
01:10:57,370 --> 01:10:59,250
你不能指揮我做什麼
You can't tell me what to do.

1022
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:01,630
只要你在我的屋裏 就必須按我說的做
When you're under my roof,you will do as I say.

1023
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:05,050
我說 你的朋友都回家去 馬上
And I'm saying your friends need to go home,now.

1024
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:06,800
天啊 你犯什麼毛病
Oh my God. What is your problem

1025
01:11:06,970 --> 01:11:08,590
算了 凱特 沒關係的
Cool it. It's... it's okay,Kat.

1026
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,680
沒錯 別著急   不是
Yeah. Don't worry about it.   No...

1027
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,970
晚安 康納斯先生
Goodnight,Mr. Connors.

1028
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,140
等等 我送你們
Wait,I'll walk you guys out.

1029
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:32,950
謝謝你讓我在朋友面前徹底蒙羞
Thank you for completely humiliating me in front of my friends.

1030
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:36,000
真他媽的高興 明天就能離開這鬼地方
So fucking glad I'm getting out of here tomorrow.

1031
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:43,000
真抱歉 我爸這麼不給面子
Sorry my dad is being such a douche.

1032
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:45,550
無所謂 反正我明天就飛走了
Whatever. I gotta fly out early tomorrow anyway.

1033
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:47,260
我也是 我包裹還沒整理呢
Me too,and I'm not even packed yet.

1034
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:49,630
你開車沒問題嗎
Sure you're okay to drive

1035
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,050
我不像你們輕量級選手 我能住搞定酒精
Unlike you lightweights,I can handle my liquor.

1036
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,850
天啊 我會想你們的
God,I'm gonna miss you guys.

1037
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:59,390
哦 天啊 小題大做的人
Oh my God,drama queen.

1038
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:02,150
很快就暑假了 到時我們還會回這個令人不爽的小窩
It'll be summer soon,and we'll be back in this rancid hellhole

1039
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:04,150
待3個月的
for three freakin' months.

1040
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:08,450
我知道
I know.

1041
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:10,490
那好 保重 別忘了寫信
Yeah,well,take care. Don't forget to write.

1042
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:13,490
會的 你也是 傻丫頭
Yeah. You too,shithead.

1043
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:15,410
再見 凱特 路上小心 好嗎
Bye,Kat. Have a safe flight,all right

1044
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:16,660
你們也是
You too.

1045
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:01,660
嘿
Hey.

1046
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,340
嘿
Hey.

1047
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:10,010
你還好嗎 你好像喝醉了
Are you all right You look drunk.

1048
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:13,680
哦 是嗎 瞧瞧誰在說話呢
Oh,yeah Look who's talking.

1049
01:13:16,970 --> 01:13:19,600
你故意躲著我 還是什麼
So you've been avoiding me on purpose,or what

1050
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:25,770
什麼意思   我上禮拜來你家
What do you mean   I came by your house last week.

1051
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:28,190
跟你媽說過我想找你談談
Told your mother that I needed to talk to you.

1052
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:32,740
是嗎 我不知道這事
Really I didn't get the message.

1053
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,490
那你想和我談什麼
What did you want to talk to me about

1054
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,790
談一些我一直在想的事情
Just been thinking about a lot of things.

1055
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,420
我覺得我媽失蹤以後
You know,I feel like after my mother left,

1056
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:48,460
我倆之間的一切都變了
everything changed between us.

1057
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:52,050
我們變了 你變了
We were different. You were different.

1058
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,970
那之後所有事都變了
Everything was different after that.

1059
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:59,260
菲爾 那天你去哪了
Phil,where were you that day

1060
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:01,470
你本應該來學校接我
You were supposed to pick me up from school.

1061
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:06,150
我告訴過你 我在托馬斯那
I told you. I was at Thomas'.

1062
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:10,070
天啊 你還沒明白嗎
My God,don't you get it

1063
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:12,320
現在這個已經不重要了 你不必撒謊了
It doesn't matter anymore. You don't have to lie.

1064
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:15,450
你什麼意思 你憑什麼說我撒謊
What do you mean What makes you think that I'm lying

1065
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:17,450
好吧 我不是因為你撒謊指責你
Okay,I'm not accusing you of lying.

1066
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:21,740
我現在的意思是 無論你知道什麼 請你告訴我
All I'm saying is whatever it is that you know,you can just tell me.

1067
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,300
知道嗎 我們以前很開心 美好
You know what What we had was sweet,and cute,

1068
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:36,220
一切都很好 但是你我都清楚我們兩個已經結束了
and great and everything,but I think we both know that it's over.

1069
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:37,410
那些都已成過去
It's in the past,

1070
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:39,470
我需要知道的是那天到底發生了什麼
and I need to know what happened that day

1071
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:42,350
好讓我的新生活繼續下去
so that I can move on with my life.

1072
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,800
求你了 菲爾 我不是在生你的氣
Please,Phil,I'm not gonna get mad at you.

1073
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,940
我只是想知道真相
I just want to know.

1074
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:51,110
我跟你說過 我什麼都不知道
I told you. I don't know anything.

1075
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:55,990
你和我媽媽之間發生過什麼嗎
Was there something going on between you and my mother

1076
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:00,490
什麼   別裝蒜了
What   You heard me.

1077
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:03,410
你是不是和我媽上床了 我有證人能證明
Were you fucking my mom Because some people think that you were.

1078
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:05,120
什麼 什麼玩意 什麼證人
What... what... what people

1079
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:09,420
凱特 你 你喝多了 你發酒瘋了
Kat,you're... you're drunk. And crazy.

1080
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:11,300
菲爾 我只是想知道真相
Phil,I just need to know

1081
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,170
求你了 我不在乎真相是什麼
Please,I don't care what it is.

1082
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:15,840
我受夠了活在這灰暗陰沉的日子裏
I just cannot keep living my life in the dark just,

1083
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:18,220
我受夠了這稀里糊塗的人生
like,fucking wondering

1084
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,600
我幫不了你 凱特
I can't help you,Kat.

1085
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,190
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1086
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:47,870
但是我可以告訴你一件事
But I will tell you one thing.

1087
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:52,210
你爸知道她在哪
Your dad knows where she is.

1088
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:54,630
他一直都把她留在身邊
He's been keeping her up his sleeve this whole time.

1089
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,260
你什麼意思
What do you mean

1090
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:06,020
別問我 去問他
Don't ask me. Ask him.

1091
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:08,750
凱特 凱特

1100
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:23,190
百憂解

1101
01:19:58,750 --> 01:19:59,960
凱特
Kat

1102
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:04,050
你在幹嗎
What are you doing

1103
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:10,550
爸
Dad

1104
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:15,810
你知道媽媽在哪嗎
Do you know where mom is

1105
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:30,200
什麼
What

1106
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:33,120
你知道媽媽在哪嗎
Do you know where mom is

1107
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:37,660
菲爾說你知道
Because Phil says that you do.

1108
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:43,750
菲爾 就那個工作都保不住的吸毒前男友
Phil Your stoner boyfriend who can't keep a job

1109
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:57,600
答案是"不 我不知道"
The answer is no,I don't.

1110
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:07,400
還有什麼事
Anything else

1111
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:19,910
那好 把這些亂七八糟的收拾乾淨
Well,clean up this mess.

1112
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:23,290
幾小時內要把你送到機場
We have to get you to the airport in a few hours.

1113
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:30,880
爸爸
Dad

1114
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:36,720
對不起
I'm sorry.

1115
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:42,180
沒關係
It's all right.

1116
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:29,320
記得打個電話 好讓爸爸知道你安全著陸
So make sure to call so I know that you landed all right.

1117
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:31,070
好
Okay.

1118
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:36,320
那幾個月後見了
So see you in a couple of months

1119
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,530
嗯
Mm hm.

1120
01:22:54,590 --> 01:22:56,300
我愛你 寶貝
I love you,baby.

1121
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:05,020
我也愛你
I love you too.

1122
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:14,900
我該上飛機了
I should probably board.

1123
01:23:20,990 --> 01:23:22,330
再見
See you.

1124
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:31,040
再見 寶貝
Goodbye,sweetheart.

1125
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,830
那是我最後一次見我父親
That was the last time I saw my father.

1126
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
事實證明貝絲 米奇和西奧是對的
It turns out Beth,Mickey and Theo were right.

1127
01:24:12,170 --> 01:24:16,510
我離開幾個星期後 爸爸在一個酒吧喝得爛醉如泥
A few weeks after I left,my dad got shitfaced drunk in a bar,

1128
01:24:16,670 --> 01:24:19,090
酒後吐真言 說出了殺死媽媽的真相
and confessed to killing my mother.

1129
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:25,510
他用監獄裏的床單上吊自殺
He hung himself in his jail cell with a sheet.

1130
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,390
在他死之前
Before he died,

1131
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:30,190
他招認了媽媽的屍體在冰櫃裏
he revealed that my mother's body was in the freezer,

1132
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:33,980
那天晚上趁我睡著的時候把屍體帶了出去
and that he'd taken it out during the night while I was sleeping.

1133
01:24:34,150 --> 01:24:38,150
他把屍體埋在山上 屍體被凍了很久
He buried her up in the mountains. Since it'd been frozen for so long,

1134
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,700
因此腐爛得特別快
her corpse decomposed freakishly fast,

1135
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:43,530
埋掉之後爛為液體
turning to liquid as it melted.

1136
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:47,410
警察把屍體挖出來的時候 基本什麼都沒剩下了
By the time they dug her up,there was basically nothing left.

1137
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,210
媽媽失蹤的時候我17歲
I was seventeen when my mother disappeared.

1138
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:59,170
那天她在家打掃 做晚飯
Like,one day she was there,cleaning,making dinner,

1139
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:03,760
第二天 她不見了
and the next... she was gone.

1140
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:22,460
停下來
Stop it.

1141
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:33,270
伊芙 別笑了
Evie,stop.

1142
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,610
伊芙
Evie.

1143
01:26:42,190 --> 01:26:43,690
別笑了
Stop.

1144
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,790
我求你了
Please.

1145
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:58,080
伊芙
Evie.

1146
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:01,550
別笑了
Stop

1147
01:27:05,050 --> 01:27:06,340
別笑了
Stop.

1148
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:28,660
我愛你
I love you.

1149
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:40,330
我愛你
I love you.

1150
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:44,710
因為我再沒見過媽媽
Because I never saw my mother again,

1151
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,880
她對我來說是缺失的
she remains in absence to me.

1152
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:50,430
一片空白
An empty space.

1153
01:27:50,590 --> 01:27:53,680
一個看不見 半記憶的幽魂
An invisible,half remembered ghost.

1154
01:27:55,930 --> 01:27:58,190
因為我再沒見過媽媽
So even now I catch myself thinking

1155
01:27:58,350 --> 01:28:00,690
某一天我會投入她的懷抱
that I'm gonna run into her some day.

1156
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:04,320
就像我在紅燈前停下 打量旁邊的車
Like I'll be at a stop light,and look over at the car next to me

1157
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:09,150
她會出現 並且不贊成的怒視我
and there she'll be,scowling at me with disapproval.

1158
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:13,450
亦或是 我帶著她穿過擁擠的街道 或者火車站
Or I'll spot her across some crowded street,or train station,

1159
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:17,910
我們朝著彼此跑過去 就像俗套的韓劇劇情一樣
and we'll run toward each other like one of those cheesy TV movies.

1160
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:22,330
她會抱住我 像久別重逢的愛人
She'll hug me like a long,lost lover,

1161
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:25,590
用她細長美妙的手
then take my face in her long,

1162
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:28,300
撫摸我的臉
graceful hands,

1163
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:30,840
盯著我的眼睛說
look me in the eyes and say...

1164
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:36,560
"我在這 凱特"
..."I'm here,Kat.

1165
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:39,770
"我就在這"
I'm here."
