2
00:01:11,548 --> 00:01:12,597
Bitch.

3
00:01:12,622 --> 00:01:14,281
Fucking bitch.

4
00:01:14,328 --> 00:01:15,456
I know where you live.

5
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:17,480
I know where your family...

6
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:19,667
This is for Maia Rindell.

7
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:21,991
I'm gonna rape you and your dyke girl...

8
00:01:23,096 --> 00:01:24,717
Hi. Good morning.

9
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:27,407
And fuck you. You stole my money.

10
00:01:27,408 --> 00:01:29,287
I just want you to hurt like I do.

11
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:40,210
Hi, it's my first day here.

12
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:43,234
And, uh, I'm not too sure where to g...

13
00:01:51,627 --> 00:01:53,533
_

14
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,587
- Maia Rindell?
- Yes!

15
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:01,133
You okay?

16
00:02:01,158 --> 00:02:03,002
Yes! Just, um...

17
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,111
Hi.

18
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:06,667
Julius Cain.

19
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,143
I'm the managing partner here.

20
00:02:08,168 --> 00:02:09,957
Let me show you to your desk.

21
00:02:09,982 --> 00:02:12,901
We have 55 associates
and 40 work stations,

22
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:15,374
so we employ a hot desk system.

23
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:18,772
Occupy any empty chair
in the communal area,

24
00:02:18,797 --> 00:02:21,046
but keep your laptop with you
because you might be returning

25
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:22,740
to a different space when you come back.

26
00:02:22,765 --> 00:02:23,852
Go ahead.

27
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:26,071
Good.

28
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:29,055
At 10:00, I'm gonna need
you at the SWSMU offices,

29
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,452
so meet me at reception in 20 minutes.

30
00:02:31,477 --> 00:02:33,860
- The what?
- SWSMU.

31
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:35,634
One of our union contracts.

32
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,353
Once a month, we offer their members

33
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:39,618
pro bono service as
part of our retainer.

34
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:40,969
20 minutes.

35
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:51,464
_

36
00:02:55,747 --> 00:02:57,622
Did you hear that, Diane?

37
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:00,357
I... yes. I just can't believe it.

38
00:03:00,382 --> 00:03:02,974
They're withholding my
capital contribution?

39
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:04,708
They say they have
to review your tenure.

40
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:07,083
What tenure?! I was a name partner.

41
00:03:07,108 --> 00:03:08,477
I created that firm.

42
00:03:08,841 --> 00:03:11,404
- It's my money.
- I'm sorry, Diane.

43
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,974
Do I have any reserves?

44
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,578
If you sell your apartment.

45
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,247
I can't do that.

46
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,537
Well, you can always
talk to your new partners,

47
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:25,997
and see if they'll offer you a loan.

48
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,167
Ah, we tried to call you at home.

49
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:50,010
- Because?
- We're moving you down the hall.

50
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,859
There's a new partner.

51
00:03:52,758 --> 00:03:54,597
We have to make room.

52
00:03:54,622 --> 00:03:55,982
Diane?

53
00:03:56,007 --> 00:03:57,189
Yep.

54
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,938
See, it's not so bad.

55
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,024
Home sweet home.

56
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:09,785
Oh, and I'm gonna need you
at the SWSMU this morning.

57
00:04:10,145 --> 00:04:12,035
Why? I did it last month.

58
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,606
Yes, and you were so good at it, too.

59
00:04:20,414 --> 00:04:21,976
Good morning.

60
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:23,538
Sharise.

61
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:27,385
Come on, come get this.

62
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,884
Come get this. Come get this!

63
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:31,963
How that college search coming?

64
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:33,947
Ah, all-consuming. Twins, you know.

65
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:35,580
Yeah, I hear you.

66
00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:37,683
Any word on the Kendall offer?

67
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,117
They called this morning.

68
00:04:39,118 --> 00:04:40,888
Who? David Lee?

69
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,131
Yes, sir.

70
00:04:43,756 --> 00:04:45,865
We're getting our six mill.

71
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,685
Diane here yet?

72
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,568
Yeah, she's in with Barbara.

73
00:04:49,828 --> 00:04:51,294
She is, huh?

74
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,496
I heard you speak at an ABA
conference a few years ago.

75
00:04:57,521 --> 00:05:00,668
- Oh, yes. On racial hiring?
- That's right.

76
00:05:02,077 --> 00:05:04,713
Oh, well, I hope I didn't
embarrass myself too much.

77
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,487
Hmm, not too much.

78
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:12,889
Diane Lockhart.

79
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:14,367
I feel like we acquired

80
00:05:14,368 --> 00:05:15,907
our very own Jimmy Butler right here.

81
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:18,862
- Adrian, how are you?
- Good, good.

82
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:20,512
A little gift for you.

83
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:21,981
Spring Arbor Lake Wine,

84
00:05:22,006 --> 00:05:24,372
my very own label, 2006. Mwah.

85
00:05:24,397 --> 00:05:25,556
You have a winery?

86
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:28,145
Ah, just a row of vines,
that's all. Sit, sit.

87
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:31,094
So how's everything going with you two?

88
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:32,633
- Barbara give you the rundown?
- She did.

89
00:05:32,658 --> 00:05:34,149
Are you two playing nice?

90
00:05:34,174 --> 00:05:36,305
- We are, Adrian.
- Good.

91
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,644
Oh, by the way, just
a housekeeping matter,

92
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:42,402
but we'll need your capital
contribution by next week.

93
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:44,840
Oh, yes, of course.

94
00:05:44,865 --> 00:05:46,571
Um, just so you know,

95
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,086
my old firm is being a bit intransigent.

96
00:05:49,111 --> 00:05:50,840
Yeah, David Lee.

97
00:05:50,865 --> 00:05:53,561
- Wonderful guy.
- So, um,

98
00:05:53,883 --> 00:05:55,796
if you don't mind being a bit patient.

99
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:56,901
Of course.

100
00:05:56,902 --> 00:05:58,772
But listen, I'll need you
in the 11:00 a.m. meeting

101
00:05:58,797 --> 00:06:01,178
to pitch cases to our
litigation financiers.

102
00:06:01,203 --> 00:06:02,562
Right.

103
00:06:02,587 --> 00:06:04,968
- Well, good. I'll see you there.
- You will.

104
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:07,788
Diane.

105
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,419
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

106
00:06:10,444 --> 00:06:11,668
Hmm.

107
00:06:17,402 --> 00:06:19,596
And how patient are we to be?

108
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:21,208
Let's give her two weeks.

109
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,792
- Hello?
- Just plugging in your computer.

110
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,224
Are you from Lockhart, Deckler?

111
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:31,919
Lee, Lyman, Deckler, Gussman...

112
00:06:31,944 --> 00:06:33,380
Well, that didn't take them very long.

113
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:35,341
I know. Bunch of assholes.

114
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:37,388
- Marissa?
- Yeah, hey.

115
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:38,655
Want me to set up anything else?

116
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,600
- No, I can do it.
- No, let me.

117
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,717
If I get back too quick,

118
00:06:41,742 --> 00:06:43,694
they'll just send me
out on another errand.

119
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,530
Here, I'll hang these.

120
00:06:45,944 --> 00:06:47,237
When Alicia hired me,

121
00:06:47,262 --> 00:06:49,303
I was supposed to be involved
in cases and everything,

122
00:06:49,328 --> 00:06:51,902
but it's been all moving
boxes since she left.

123
00:06:52,347 --> 00:06:53,668
Still want this?

124
00:06:54,637 --> 00:06:56,191
Definitely.

125
00:06:56,593 --> 00:06:59,496
And, uh, where do you want these?

126
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:02,540
- What are those?
- African masks.

127
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:04,989
Well, I can see that.
Where are they from?

128
00:07:05,014 --> 00:07:06,481
Your office.

129
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:08,204
No.

130
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:11,562
David Lee. Very funny.

131
00:07:11,587 --> 00:07:14,945
By the way, I know you still
need an assistant, Diane.

132
00:07:15,578 --> 00:07:17,554
- Hello.
- Uh, this is Marissa,

133
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:18,778
from my old firm.

134
00:07:18,803 --> 00:07:21,125
Hi. Just dropping stuff off.

135
00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:25,756
Well, I have a few
people coming in today

136
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:27,093
for possible assistants.

137
00:07:27,118 --> 00:07:28,655
I'll send them by.

138
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,998
Thank you.

139
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:35,620
Okay, I don't want to
sound self-serving here,

140
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:38,018
but I think it's a smart
move for you to hire me.

141
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:40,112
Oh, good to know. Thank you.

142
00:07:40,137 --> 00:07:41,761
No, seriously. You need an assistant.

143
00:07:41,786 --> 00:07:43,245
I can do whatever you want around here,

144
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,177
and I'm not that expensive.
What are you paying?

145
00:07:45,202 --> 00:07:47,513
Why don't you just leave
your résumé, Marissa?

146
00:07:47,538 --> 00:07:49,640
I don't have one. I'm much
better in person, anyway.

147
00:07:49,665 --> 00:07:51,546
Look, just hire me for one day,

148
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:52,882
just until you get someone better.

149
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:54,987
And I promise you won't
get someone better.

150
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,736
You limit your pro bono consultations

151
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:00,303
to 20 minutes each.

152
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:03,375
If their legal issues require
more time, go to Lucca.

153
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,364
She will sign off on more time.

154
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:06,974
Remember, you're only here

155
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:09,708
to offer legal advice, not legal work.

156
00:08:09,787 --> 00:08:11,138
Don't get tied down.

157
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:12,906
Move people on into other

158
00:08:12,907 --> 00:08:14,661
legal resources when you can:

159
00:08:14,686 --> 00:08:16,917
Prairie State or Legal Assistance.

160
00:08:16,942 --> 00:08:19,973
You're the "door close"
button in the elevator.

161
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:22,841
Comforting, but not
necessarily effective.

162
00:08:22,866 --> 00:08:24,286
Here we go.

163
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:27,950
Okay, members, listen up, listen up.

164
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:30,902
Remember these lawyers are
here as union advocates,

165
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,401
so please limit your
questions to workplace matters.

166
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:35,925
Only workplace matters.

167
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,464
Okay, who is here on their work
break, please raise your hand.

168
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:40,567
Oh, come on.

169
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:42,687
Donny, I know it's your
day off. Get your hand down.

170
00:08:42,712 --> 00:08:45,397
Only people on their lunch break.

171
00:08:45,422 --> 00:08:46,766
Come on, you're only screwing over

172
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:48,606
your union brother and sister.

173
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:49,695
Good.

174
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,904
Those on lunch break,
come on up to the stage.

175
00:08:51,988 --> 00:08:54,947
Line up for each desk. Let's go.

176
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,947
You're seriously telling me
I have to go to someone else

177
00:08:59,948 --> 00:09:01,165
on my lunch break?

178
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,939
The thing is, ma'am,
we're not really here

179
00:09:02,964 --> 00:09:04,987
to help with family law issues,

180
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,752
but, uh, I can refer you to...

181
00:09:06,777 --> 00:09:08,696
He's not paying child support!

182
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:11,205
How am I supposed to make ends
meet if he won't pay child support?

183
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,605
I know, I'm sorry. It's just...

184
00:09:14,332 --> 00:09:15,987
Well, I'm not really
supposed to help with...

185
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,857
Then why are you here?

186
00:09:18,076 --> 00:09:20,543
If you can't help, why are you here?

187
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:25,817
I need help.

188
00:09:25,818 --> 00:09:27,158
Hello.

189
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:44,357
Oh, come on.

190
00:09:50,092 --> 00:09:51,841
I'm gonna help you out here.

191
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:53,405
Thank you.

192
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:56,350
Sir, would you like to come to my desk?

193
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,294
No, I'm good here.

194
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:01,632
I'm a third-year associate.
She just passed the bar.

195
00:10:01,657 --> 00:10:02,897
That's okay.

196
00:10:02,922 --> 00:10:04,718
I'm sticking.

197
00:10:08,656 --> 00:10:09,910
Next?

198
00:10:11,804 --> 00:10:15,254
I, I just can't survive on $400 a week.

199
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,568
I can't pay for my rent.

200
00:10:16,593 --> 00:10:18,339
I can't pay for my ex-wife.

201
00:10:18,364 --> 00:10:20,269
And they're not adjusting
it for after taxes.

202
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:21,972
They're just taking
it right off the top.

203
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,745
I-I'm sorry, I don't understand.

204
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,549
You're... you're being paid $400 a week?

205
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:27,793
Yeah.

206
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:29,204
Wait, no.

207
00:10:29,205 --> 00:10:31,218
And my rent is twice that. Okay?

208
00:10:31,243 --> 00:10:33,414
- Do you need to get that?
- No.

209
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:35,374
- Uh, no. It does that.
- _

210
00:10:35,577 --> 00:10:36,994
Yeah, mine, too.

211
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:38,284
You know, I used to get some good news,

212
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:39,893
but now I feel like it's all bad.

213
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:42,580
I don't even like answering it nowadays.

214
00:10:43,785 --> 00:10:45,763
So, um, I'm sorry,

215
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:47,411
I'm, I'm not too sure

216
00:10:47,436 --> 00:10:49,685
how they were able to lower your salary.

217
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,793
Not lower. Garnish.

218
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,192
They're saying that I
stole 400 running shoes.

219
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:55,918
- What? 400 running shoes?
- Yeah.

220
00:10:55,943 --> 00:10:58,605
And they say that's
$70,000, but that's retail,

221
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,942
and they don't pay retail.
They just pay wholesale,

222
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:03,192
- so it should be half that.
- Wait, I'm sorry.

223
00:11:03,217 --> 00:11:05,410
Could-could you start again?

224
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:06,864
Okay.

225
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:08,930
- BMI...
- Mm-hmm.

226
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:12,199
... my store says that
I stole 400 running shoes.

227
00:11:12,224 --> 00:11:13,564
And did you?

228
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,534
No, I've never stolen
anything in my entire life.

229
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,085
But they're garnishing my
wages for the retail amount,

230
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,249
and it should be the wholesale amount.

231
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:23,220
That's double what I should pay!

232
00:11:23,245 --> 00:11:24,586
But if you didn't steal anything,

233
00:11:24,611 --> 00:11:26,773
why are you letting them
garnish your wages at all?

234
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:28,187
Because I signed a confession.

235
00:11:29,858 --> 00:11:31,807
I don't understand. Why did he confess?

236
00:11:31,832 --> 00:11:33,078
They pressured him to.

237
00:11:33,103 --> 00:11:35,640
They threatened to
fire him if he didn't.

238
00:11:35,665 --> 00:11:37,244
He just wants them to charge him

239
00:11:37,245 --> 00:11:39,476
the wholesale amount and
not the retail amount.

240
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:41,550
And he wants to go to
arbitration for that?

241
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,421
Well, his contract requires
that he go to arbitration.

242
00:11:44,446 --> 00:11:46,855
But he wants me to represent him.

243
00:11:46,918 --> 00:11:48,377
I just need you to sign me off

244
00:11:48,402 --> 00:11:50,185
on two more hours work.

245
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:52,956
You know this is just pro bono?

246
00:11:52,981 --> 00:11:54,725
Right? It's a goodwill gesture.

247
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,164
- We're not here to right a wrong.
- No, I know, but...

248
00:11:57,428 --> 00:11:59,140
it's only two hours work.

249
00:11:59,165 --> 00:12:00,570
I want to do it.

250
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,254
When's the arbitration?

251
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,968
This afternoon.

252
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:05,614
Okay.

253
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:07,165
Good luck.

254
00:12:07,681 --> 00:12:09,595
Everything good with you?

255
00:12:11,952 --> 00:12:13,251
Yeah.

256
00:12:14,979 --> 00:12:18,398
Yeah, for the first
time in a while... yes.

257
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:21,920
It's good when you can focus
on someone else's problem.

258
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:28,963
First place I've been
I wasn't recognized.

259
00:12:36,448 --> 00:12:39,078
This is our highest priority case.

260
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:41,496
It's a hanging in a
jail cell... Holly Orlin.

261
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:44,613
You'll find a Chicago
Tribune article on top there.

262
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:47,074
This is the worst Cook County jail abuse

263
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:49,244
I have seen in years.

264
00:12:49,245 --> 00:12:50,664
So, we're suing for $12 million,

265
00:12:50,665 --> 00:12:52,731
but we do expect
settlement before trial.

266
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:54,534
- Any videotape?
- No.

267
00:12:54,535 --> 00:12:56,373
But we have a very sympathetic family

268
00:12:56,398 --> 00:12:58,244
and a grieving widower.

269
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:01,615
So, all we need of your
financing is $300 thousand.

270
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,428
- Mm-mm.
- No. Thanks, though.

271
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:07,342
Our algorithm is going
cool on police suits.

272
00:13:07,764 --> 00:13:09,284
You sure about that?

273
00:13:09,285 --> 00:13:11,277
Mm-hmm. What else?

274
00:13:11,302 --> 00:13:13,878
Well, I think that, uh,
Diane, our newest partner...

275
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:16,204
she just joined us from
Lockhart, Deckler & Gussman...

276
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:17,441
can speak to a new case.

277
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:20,175
Uh, we've been looking
into parole abuses.

278
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,453
Some parolees have been rejected

279
00:13:22,478 --> 00:13:24,279
for, uh, punitive reasons.

280
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,527
Hmm.

281
00:13:25,552 --> 00:13:28,851
I think my partner worries
there's no money there.

282
00:13:28,898 --> 00:13:30,965
That depends on how
vulnerable the State feels.

283
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,191
No. It depends on the trend.

284
00:13:33,216 --> 00:13:34,730
The trend is against you.

285
00:13:34,755 --> 00:13:38,394
Look, now we understand you have
your little algebraic spells,

286
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:39,941
but we understand the system.

287
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:42,635
And you'll get ten
percent of our earnings.

288
00:13:43,245 --> 00:13:45,955
Why don't you let us
help you make some money?

289
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,736
What else have you got?

290
00:13:48,818 --> 00:13:50,039
- Malpractice?
- Mm-hmm.

291
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:52,045
It's a malpractice suit.

292
00:13:54,716 --> 00:13:56,990
- Uh, excuse me.
- Yeah.

293
00:13:57,015 --> 00:13:59,220
- Second page.
- What's wrong?

294
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:01,574
Someone here to see you. Lenore Rindell.

295
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:03,731
- Where?
- In your office.

296
00:14:03,756 --> 00:14:05,668
You want me to get rid of her?

297
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,379
What do you need, Lenore?

298
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,254
- I-I came to see Maia.
- She's out.

299
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,168
She's not talking to me,
she's not answering my calls.

300
00:14:18,193 --> 00:14:20,164
My guess is her lawyer told her not to.

301
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:22,769
Can you talk to her, Diane? Please.

302
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,401
No.

303
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:27,596
Why?

304
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:29,495
I don't know what bubble
you're living in, Lenore,

305
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,729
but you do see my office here?

306
00:14:30,754 --> 00:14:32,324
You do see that I am not retired,

307
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:33,324
that I am still working.

308
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:34,954
This wasn't us. This was Jax.

309
00:14:34,979 --> 00:14:36,683
This is his Ponzi scheme, not ours...

310
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,966
You want to have an honest
conversation here, then let's have it.

311
00:14:38,991 --> 00:14:41,052
I came to you last week
and asked for my money back,

312
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:42,888
so that I could buy my dream
house, and what did you say?

313
00:14:42,913 --> 00:14:44,083
- We didn't...
- No, I want to hear you say it.

314
00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:45,826
- What did you say?
- This wasn't us.

315
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,226
You said keep it in your
account, and borrow on it.

316
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:50,070
I could've had my money back.

317
00:14:50,095 --> 00:14:51,202
I...

318
00:14:52,932 --> 00:14:55,102
I think it's a good idea that you go.

319
00:14:57,635 --> 00:15:00,165
Diane, look at me.

320
00:15:01,885 --> 00:15:03,563
I'm innocent.

321
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:05,627
Henry's innocent.

322
00:15:05,925 --> 00:15:07,634
You are a defense lawyer.

323
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:09,908
Why can't you extend
us the same courtesy

324
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:12,149
you do your other clients?

325
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:14,983
We are wrongly accused.

326
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:16,905
Just because the Feds say it

327
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,930
doesn't make it true.

328
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:25,277
I'll tell Maia that you dropped by.

329
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:37,075
I know I shouldn't ask this, but...

330
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,262
Henry needs your help.

331
00:15:40,245 --> 00:15:43,044
He's in jail and no one will visit him.

332
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:47,384
His lawyer's advising
him to plead guilty,

333
00:15:47,385 --> 00:15:49,425
but I don't think he should.

334
00:15:50,956 --> 00:15:53,608
He's your oldest friend, Diane.

335
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:56,505
Will you talk to him?

336
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,897
So it's like a trial?

337
00:16:07,922 --> 00:16:10,171
Yes, just answer honestly.

338
00:16:10,196 --> 00:16:11,905
That's all you have to do.

339
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,469
And if I lose?

340
00:16:13,715 --> 00:16:15,854
Well, there's no appeal, so...

341
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,948
if you lose, you lose.

342
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:20,813
Frank Gwinn.

343
00:16:21,145 --> 00:16:22,387
Here.

344
00:16:23,302 --> 00:16:24,899
Go ahead. You're the lawyer?

345
00:16:24,924 --> 00:16:27,113
Uh, yes, from Reddick, Boseman &...

346
00:16:27,138 --> 00:16:28,941
- Good, I'm the arbiter.
- ... Kolstad...

347
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:30,145
Let's hear it.

348
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,669
And this is Benji Diyardian

349
00:16:31,694 --> 00:16:33,818
from BMI's loss-prevention department.

350
00:16:33,843 --> 00:16:35,616
He questioned me.

351
00:16:35,671 --> 00:16:38,335
- Let's hear it.
- I...

352
00:16:40,518 --> 00:16:42,387
Good afternoon.

353
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:45,181
Frank's employer, BMI,

354
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:48,945
a sporting good store
with $12 billion in assets

355
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,798
and franchises throughout the country...

356
00:16:50,823 --> 00:16:52,492
Yeah, I-I don't need that.

357
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:55,131
Right. Um...

358
00:16:55,303 --> 00:16:58,094
They have accused my client of stealing

359
00:16:58,095 --> 00:17:00,256
400 running shoes from their back-stock.

360
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:02,506
- 417.
- Objection.

361
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,877
Okay, um,

362
00:17:05,903 --> 00:17:08,150
- and he didn't do it, right?
- Uh, that is correct, sir.

363
00:17:08,175 --> 00:17:10,004
He did not do it.

364
00:17:10,303 --> 00:17:11,682
What do you need, ma'am?

365
00:17:11,707 --> 00:17:14,119
I'm here as an observer for the union.

366
00:17:14,675 --> 00:17:15,832
Why?

367
00:17:15,857 --> 00:17:18,160
We just want to make
sure everything's fair.

368
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,390
Okay, keep going, miss.

369
00:17:25,595 --> 00:17:28,160
My client did not steal any shoes.

370
00:17:28,185 --> 00:17:30,854
He has no record and
yet the company, BMI,

371
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:33,312
have chosen to garnish
his salary by almost 40%.

372
00:17:33,337 --> 00:17:35,051
We didn't garnish
anything, he confessed.

373
00:17:35,076 --> 00:17:37,278
No, excuse me, sir,
you'll have your chance.

374
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:40,375
Um, this is a massive,

375
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,727
$12 billion company

376
00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:44,164
stealing half my client's pay.

377
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,212
Stealing, really? We have
his confession on the record.

378
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:47,580
No, he was forced to confess.

379
00:17:47,605 --> 00:17:49,931
- He was told if he did not confess...
- He was not told anything.

380
00:17:49,956 --> 00:17:52,696
If he did not confess,
then he would be fired.

381
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:54,823
Frank, how long did
this man question you?

382
00:17:54,848 --> 00:17:56,776
- Seven hours.
- Without break.

383
00:17:56,801 --> 00:17:58,190
He was told he could not leave the room.

384
00:17:58,215 --> 00:17:59,932
Only because he's an employee
and he was on the clock.

385
00:17:59,957 --> 00:18:01,327
Let me see the confession.

386
00:18:02,896 --> 00:18:05,400
Would the union rep like to see it, too?

387
00:18:05,425 --> 00:18:07,356
Uh, I would, thank you.

388
00:18:08,764 --> 00:18:10,778
Mr. Arbiter, as you read
that, please remember

389
00:18:10,803 --> 00:18:12,781
that he was forced to
sign that confession.

390
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:15,480
I never forced anyone.
This is the Friedman method.

391
00:18:15,776 --> 00:18:18,159
- I never diverged once from it at all.
- The what?

392
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:20,386
The Friedman method, it's
a process of questioning

393
00:18:20,411 --> 00:18:22,415
I was trained and certified in.

394
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:25,942
Sir,

395
00:18:26,624 --> 00:18:29,044
is this your signature?

396
00:18:29,045 --> 00:18:30,536
Yes.

397
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:33,411
Then in exercise of powers
conferred under Clause 25

398
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:35,208
of the agreement entered
into between the parties,

399
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:37,891
judgment is made in
favor of the respondent.

400
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,766
Wait, w-what? What, that's it?

401
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,398
Thank you, I'll see
the next arbitration.

402
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:45,595
- But he didn't do it!
- I'll see the next arbitration.

403
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:51,611
False imprisonment.

404
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:56,190
Mr. Arbiter, we ask
that the arbitration...

405
00:18:56,215 --> 00:18:57,627
be reopened...

406
00:18:57,652 --> 00:19:00,821
based on the matter
of false imprisonment.

407
00:19:01,095 --> 00:19:03,002
- Oh, come on...
- My client was held

408
00:19:03,027 --> 00:19:04,744
against his will for seven hours,

409
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:08,314
in direct contravention
of... everything.

410
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:11,239
The issue of false
imprisonment is irrelevant.

411
00:19:11,264 --> 00:19:14,147
Judgment is again made in
favor of the respondent.

412
00:19:14,172 --> 00:19:16,092
That's not your decision to make, sir.

413
00:19:16,117 --> 00:19:17,706
Excuse me?

414
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:20,341
The arbitration agreement
with Ms. Rindell's client

415
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:21,981
does not cover tort claims.

416
00:19:22,006 --> 00:19:24,546
And false imprisonment is a tort claim.

417
00:19:26,395 --> 00:19:29,148
- Then we are stalemated.
- No, we're not.

418
00:19:29,173 --> 00:19:32,616
- And why is that?
- Because we'll see you in court.

419
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:03,963
Henry.

420
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,619
How are you?

421
00:20:14,336 --> 00:20:17,579
Rupert tells me I should
accept a guilty plea.

422
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,579
20 years.

423
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:22,040
What do you think?

424
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:24,900
I think this is bad, Hank.

425
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,999
Yeah, you and I, Diane,

426
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,369
we always told each other the truth.

427
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,039
No matter where... in college, after,

428
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,598
before Lenore.

429
00:20:35,623 --> 00:20:37,385
And I'm telling you the truth now.

430
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,169
I did not do this.

431
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:44,450
Hank, what am I
supposed to do with that?

432
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:47,278
I am bankrupted, completely.

433
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,685
Two months ago, I hired
a forensics accountant

434
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,209
to look into Jax's trades.

435
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,039
There was $83 million missing.

436
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,209
The accountant found
Jax had moved the money

437
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,209
into his private account.

438
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,399
I tried to confront
him, but before I could,

439
00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:05,477
Jax went to the Feds to turn me in.

440
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,022
You should be telling this
to your lawyer, not to me.

441
00:21:10,047 --> 00:21:11,899
I did, but Rupert
said it doesn't matter.

442
00:21:11,924 --> 00:21:14,000
There are too many bad facts.

443
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,762
Okay.

444
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:22,862
Let me look into another lawyer.

445
00:21:22,887 --> 00:21:25,119
- Why not you?
- No.

446
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,410
You need someone objective.

447
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:33,114
How's Maia?

448
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:35,079
- She's doing well.
- Good.

449
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,651
She's on a case.

450
00:21:39,485 --> 00:21:41,565
She's gonna blow us all away.

451
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,932
Did she see her mom?

452
00:21:47,971 --> 00:21:49,174
No.

453
00:21:49,821 --> 00:21:52,425
I think it's best that she stay away

454
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,039
until all this gets straightened out.

455
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:58,079
But that could be years.

456
00:21:58,595 --> 00:22:00,090
I know.

457
00:22:04,082 --> 00:22:05,829
Lenore didn't tell you?

458
00:22:06,379 --> 00:22:07,988
Tell me what?

459
00:22:08,013 --> 00:22:09,551
She doesn't have years.

460
00:22:09,576 --> 00:22:11,815
Her breast cancer, it's back.

461
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,863
Spread to her lymph nodes.

462
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:23,360
Maybe I should go see her.

463
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:26,346
I'd talk to your lawyer first.

464
00:22:27,182 --> 00:22:29,352
You don't think I should go see her?

465
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:32,852
No, it's just...

466
00:22:34,304 --> 00:22:36,656
I think you should be careful.

467
00:22:40,018 --> 00:22:42,831
She misunderstood my
intent, or she ignored it,

468
00:22:42,856 --> 00:22:44,508
but we just don't have time for this.

469
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:46,370
and we raise expectations

470
00:22:46,395 --> 00:22:48,095
for what our firm can do!

471
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,579
Ah, Lucca.

472
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,159
It seems we picked up
a new case this morning.

473
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:54,616
I told you we didn't want to get
tangled up in small-ball litigation.

474
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:56,329
This is not small-ball.

475
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:58,686
BMI has $12 billion in assets...

476
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,829
Yes, and there won't be
any punitive damages here.

477
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,079
- But we don't know that.
- We do know that.

478
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,553
This is one union member,

479
00:23:04,578 --> 00:23:06,780
and we're about to put
in 40 billable hours,

480
00:23:06,805 --> 00:23:09,669
to get him what, $20,000 in back pay?

481
00:23:09,694 --> 00:23:12,764
Is this about you losing
your office to a partner?

482
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,435
No.

483
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,119
This is about a good case.

484
00:23:19,521 --> 00:23:22,449
Hey, do you know what
the Friedman Method is?

485
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,138
The Friedman Method?

486
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,685
Yeah, it's a way to
interrogate a suspect... why?

487
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,417
It's a case I'm on.

488
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:30,841
How do I find out more about it?

489
00:23:30,866 --> 00:23:32,659
Easily, they have seminars.

490
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,079
Just look them up online.

491
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,619
You pay the money, and you, too,

492
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,289
can learn how to be a cop.

493
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,579
Good to know.

494
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,035
Oh, okay. I got to go, bye.

495
00:23:41,957 --> 00:23:44,207
- We're being shut down.
- What?

496
00:23:44,232 --> 00:23:45,709
They're worried the case is too small.

497
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,249
You're kidding.

498
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,209
I was just about to sign
up for a Friedman seminar

499
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,881
to find out more.

500
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:57,385
You know what, do it anyway.

501
00:23:57,616 --> 00:23:59,294
It's on our time.

502
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,841
Why not?

503
00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:02,833
Okay.

504
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,869
People lie.

505
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:09,310
And when people lie,
they want to confess...

506
00:24:09,335 --> 00:24:10,709
it's human nature.

507
00:24:10,814 --> 00:24:13,978
Your job... you and you and you...

508
00:24:14,003 --> 00:24:15,291
is to enable that process.

509
00:24:15,316 --> 00:24:18,619
You are a crucial step
to their cleansing.

510
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,079
What you will learn over
the next four sessions

511
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,999
is the Friedman method.

512
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,078
A way to determine guilt...

513
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,180
and obtain a confession.

514
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,529
One of these four people is lying.

515
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:33,383
They all deny taking
money from a cash register,

516
00:24:33,408 --> 00:24:35,407
but one of them did.

517
00:24:35,748 --> 00:24:38,121
The first step in the Friedman Method is

518
00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:39,329
ascertain guilt.

519
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,654
Find out who is lying.

520
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:44,433
Look, I didn't do it.

521
00:24:44,434 --> 00:24:46,714
I wasn't even there. That's the truth.

522
00:24:46,739 --> 00:24:48,329
Pretty convincing, huh?

523
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:50,499
But ignore the words.
They're irrelevant.

524
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,499
Everybody swears they're innocent,

525
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,831
but no one can hide their face.

526
00:24:54,856 --> 00:24:57,293
No one can hide their expressions.

527
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,768
The most important thing is to get
the suspect to look right at you

528
00:25:00,793 --> 00:25:03,941
and repeat the statement over and over.

529
00:25:04,363 --> 00:25:05,579
Let's watch it again.

530
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,949
I'm going to slow down the image.

531
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,998
Look, I didn't do it.

532
00:25:09,154 --> 00:25:11,079
I wasn't even there...

533
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,849
- That's the truth...
- There!

534
00:25:12,874 --> 00:25:15,678
Right there. See? Under his lip?

535
00:25:16,076 --> 00:25:17,369
The risorius muscle.

536
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,999
It's part of the expression of fear.

537
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,100
When we are experiencing anxiety,

538
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:23,925
the risorius muscle will become tense.

539
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,296
Look for it.

540
00:25:25,321 --> 00:25:26,882
I wasn't even there.

541
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,949
- That's the truth.
- See?

542
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:30,539
Clenched muscle.

543
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,749
Good. Another telltale sign
of anxiety, the forehead.

544
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,318
When there is a burst of anxiety,

545
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:37,012
these muscles will tighten up,

546
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:38,620
the eyebrows will rise upward,

547
00:25:38,645 --> 00:25:40,515
only for a second... see?

548
00:25:40,516 --> 00:25:43,089
The liar wants to force his expressions

549
00:25:43,114 --> 00:25:45,329
to look relaxed, in control.

550
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,749
Therefore, the expression
you're looking for

551
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,580
is fleeting, momentary.

552
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:54,713
Do you think that's true,

553
00:25:54,738 --> 00:25:57,079
the way to discover a liar?

554
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,249
No, it's bad psychology.

555
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,539
How do you mean?

556
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,320
"Ignore the words"?

557
00:26:02,345 --> 00:26:03,772
Seriously?

558
00:26:03,797 --> 00:26:05,515
How does someone prove their innocence

559
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,159
without explaining why they're innocent?

560
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,519
And he says it's all
about detecting anxiety.

561
00:26:10,544 --> 00:26:13,699
Well, I don't care how innocent you are,

562
00:26:13,724 --> 00:26:15,539
if a cop calls you in for questioning,

563
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,079
you're gonna be anxious.

564
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,433
So what does anxiety prove?

565
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,353
What if there is no cop?

566
00:26:21,378 --> 00:26:23,957
What if there is no
reason to be anxious?

567
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,361
I don't know. Everybody's different.

568
00:26:26,632 --> 00:26:29,382
Everybody's got their tell. I don't...

569
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,135
What?

570
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,947
This isn't a small thing.

571
00:26:42,972 --> 00:26:45,119
This is a massive class action.

572
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,867
Every multi-billion
dollar nationwide retailer

573
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:50,823
is sending middle-management
to these seminars...

574
00:26:50,848 --> 00:26:54,079
East Wing Running Shoes,
Widespread Tech, B&X...

575
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,332
I thought these seminars
were about training cops.

576
00:26:56,357 --> 00:26:58,039
That's how they were intended,

577
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,999
but retail stores are
using the same techniques

578
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,829
against their own employees,

579
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,684
and it's just as likely to
result in a false positive.

580
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:06,993
Barbara, what do you think?

581
00:27:07,018 --> 00:27:08,558
It's good.

582
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:12,040
Go certify a class.

583
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:17,472
We should put Bobby on it with her.

584
00:27:17,497 --> 00:27:18,619
It's a big thing now.

585
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,872
- Who's on it with her right now?
- The new associate, Maia.

586
00:27:20,897 --> 00:27:23,636
I'd keep her on it. Maia's good.

587
00:27:23,661 --> 00:27:25,329
And she's motivated.

588
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,159
- That Rindell kid?
- Yes.

589
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,654
Sure. Everybody hates her.

590
00:27:29,866 --> 00:27:31,802
Great way to mold a fighter.

591
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:33,429
All right.

592
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,999
There may not even be a job here.

593
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,950
I just want to warn you.

594
00:27:46,294 --> 00:27:48,830
Uh, you're here for
the assistant position?

595
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:51,112
Come on in... Daniela?

596
00:27:58,066 --> 00:27:59,464
Have a seat.

597
00:28:05,664 --> 00:28:07,635
This is still your case, Frank,

598
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,829
but it's also now a class action.

599
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,402
- So I don't pay anything?
- Right.

600
00:28:11,427 --> 00:28:14,470
And it's more likely that
you'll get a larger settlement,

601
00:28:14,495 --> 00:28:17,041
because these big companies will
want to avoid the embarrassment.

602
00:28:17,066 --> 00:28:19,621
Is this going to move quickly now,
because I'm having trouble paying rent.

603
00:28:19,646 --> 00:28:22,973
We think the companies will try
to win this motion to dismiss.

604
00:28:22,998 --> 00:28:25,457
And if not, they'll
negotiate a settlement.

605
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,121
- All right, do I have to sign something?
- Yes.

606
00:28:27,146 --> 00:28:29,209
And, actually, you can help us, Frank.

607
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,135
We're looking for other workers

608
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,460
who have had their wages
garnished, just like you.

609
00:28:33,485 --> 00:28:35,865
- So, if you...
- What is this case again?

610
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,999
We're gathering a
class of retail workers

611
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,874
who were wrongly accused of
stealing from their stores.

612
00:28:42,906 --> 00:28:44,491
Okay, got it.

613
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,789
So are you coming back to work?

614
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,025
Everybody misses you.

615
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,211
No, I got another job.

616
00:28:53,236 --> 00:28:54,845
In fact, can you help me out with it?

617
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,249
You know everybody around here.

618
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,556
Is there anybody in the
mall who had their wages cut?

619
00:28:58,581 --> 00:29:01,635
We're bringing a lawsuit against
all these big asshole companies,

620
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,956
and I know you know all the
people here and how they complain.

621
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:07,095
So is anybody bitching
about their paychecks?

622
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,002
It's about people
being forced to confess

623
00:29:09,027 --> 00:29:11,946
that they stole clothing
or shoes or computers.

624
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:15,010
So if you hear anything
from anybody, here's my card.

625
00:29:15,035 --> 00:29:16,319
Tell them to call me.

626
00:29:28,691 --> 00:29:30,209
What the hell are you doing, Barbara?

627
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,949
What am I doing? I'm having a sandwich.

628
00:29:31,974 --> 00:29:33,675
You're dragging my members
into a class action.

629
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,056
If this is about the salary
garnishing, we're not drag...

630
00:29:36,081 --> 00:29:38,040
You're pissing off management!

631
00:29:38,438 --> 00:29:40,555
We're on the eve of a
contract negotiation,

632
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,782
and you're pissing off management.

633
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:43,678
It was a union-member complaint.

634
00:29:43,703 --> 00:29:45,428
- We are merely...
- No, no, no, no.

635
00:29:45,453 --> 00:29:47,526
You convinced him to
pursue a class action,

636
00:29:47,551 --> 00:29:49,377
because you wanted the money.

637
00:29:49,402 --> 00:29:51,731
You came into our offices
and asked for our help

638
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,377
to collect a class...

639
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:55,055
Those two did.

640
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,643
- Your contract is with us.
- Yes.

641
00:29:56,668 --> 00:29:58,845
And you employed us to
help your members and...

642
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,925
As a gesture, merely.

643
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,659
Uh, maybe your members
would like to know that.

644
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:05,587
Seriously?

645
00:30:05,777 --> 00:30:07,659
That's how little our
contract means to you?

646
00:30:07,684 --> 00:30:08,745
- You're threatening me?
- God,

647
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,556
if that's considered a threat, friend,

648
00:30:10,581 --> 00:30:13,001
I would love to live in your world.

649
00:30:13,415 --> 00:30:15,406
We won't pay a cent
for this class action,

650
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:18,220
and we won't help in
any way. So drop it.

651
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:26,367
What are you gonna do?

652
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,950
We're gonna find another benefactor.

653
00:30:31,921 --> 00:30:33,882
So what do you have?

654
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:37,329
A new suit. Very last-minute.

655
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,200
Class action against
12 nationwide retailers.

656
00:30:40,225 --> 00:30:43,949
- I'll need financing on, say, 140...
- How many in the class?

657
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,579
We're gathering that as we speak,

658
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,909
but we think 20, maybe more.

659
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,999
Sympathetic, working-class families,

660
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,659
all retail workers.

661
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:51,999
Who's the test case?

662
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,499
Top of page three.

663
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,728
Frank Gwinn, 32 years old.

664
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:57,212
Divorced father.

665
00:30:57,237 --> 00:30:59,159
Good witness. College-educated.

666
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,209
Worked at BMI selling shoes.

667
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,449
No litigation in his
background, and no priors.

668
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,619
- Uh, he's delinquent on a loan.
- It's a student loan.

669
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,556
2012. He's making payments again.

670
00:31:08,581 --> 00:31:10,079
Your proposal?

671
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:12,744
You finance 600 billable hours

672
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:14,369
for an initial payment of $300,000.

673
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,300
You'll have two exit ramps. One,

674
00:31:16,325 --> 00:31:17,698
after the motion to dismiss.

675
00:31:17,723 --> 00:31:19,249
Two, six months into trial,

676
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,209
if we even go that long.

677
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,597
You share 40% of the award,

678
00:31:23,622 --> 00:31:27,032
up to $8 million.

679
00:31:29,174 --> 00:31:30,514
No.

680
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:33,449
Why?

681
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,209
You can't get better.

682
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,209
Your motion to dismiss is in
front of Judge Kevin Drago?

683
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,249
We've won in front of him before.

684
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,999
Our algorithm doesn't like him.

685
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,119
Not for this case.

686
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,949
Your algorithm's not taking into account

687
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,788
that I'm a fucking good lawyer.

688
00:31:45,813 --> 00:31:48,072
Don't swear, okay?

689
00:31:48,295 --> 00:31:49,955
It bugs out Jer.

690
00:31:52,073 --> 00:31:53,411
I'm sorry.

691
00:31:56,646 --> 00:31:58,699
Does your algorithm even like this case?

692
00:31:58,724 --> 00:31:59,749
It does.

693
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,579
Good optics, good potential pay-out.

694
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,119
It's just this judge.

695
00:32:03,268 --> 00:32:06,127
It's okay, I will get you a new judge.

696
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,244
- How you gonna do that?
- I'm a good lawyer.

697
00:32:14,678 --> 00:32:16,217
We're going to court.

698
00:32:16,242 --> 00:32:18,661
Fuck the union, we will
finance this thing ourselves.

699
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,075
You, I want you in court.

700
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,015
Uh, uh, what is your name again?

701
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,829
- Maia.
- Maia. Great.

702
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,709
- Second chair.
- I... well, thank you, sir.

703
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,964
Unfortunately we've
run into a snag, Adrian.

704
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:30,529
- What?
- The class.

705
00:32:30,554 --> 00:32:31,845
Without the union's help,

706
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,786
we're having trouble locating employees

707
00:32:33,811 --> 00:32:34,999
with garnished wages.

708
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,209
Check crime reports.

709
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:38,451
Any business missing back-stock
they'd report it, right?

710
00:32:38,476 --> 00:32:39,870
No. They tried that.

711
00:32:39,895 --> 00:32:41,684
Let's post fliers. Let's check Reddit.

712
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,382
Let's get creative.

713
00:32:43,407 --> 00:32:44,812
I've told our financial partners

714
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,390
that we would have 20
members in the class,

715
00:32:46,415 --> 00:32:48,140
so let's get to it, all right?

716
00:32:48,165 --> 00:32:50,449
Here's 23 employees who
were accused of theft

717
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,372
by their employer and
had their wages garnished.

718
00:32:52,397 --> 00:32:54,258
And I have feelers out to a dozen more.

719
00:32:54,283 --> 00:32:56,971
And there are two more
people here to be interviewed.

720
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,721
Who is that?

721
00:33:04,588 --> 00:33:06,500
My new assistant.

722
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,523
You want me to recuse myself?

723
00:33:13,942 --> 00:33:16,726
Yes, Your Honor. Regretfully.

724
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:19,437
- You don't like me, Counselor?
- No, I love you.

725
00:33:19,462 --> 00:33:23,140
At our firm, we speak very highly
of you all the time, Your Honor.

726
00:33:23,165 --> 00:33:24,616
But unfortunately, in this instance,

727
00:33:24,641 --> 00:33:25,850
there is a conflict of interest.

728
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:28,233
We're good here, Your Honor. No problem.

729
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,469
Isn't this just a motion to dismiss?

730
00:33:30,494 --> 00:33:32,866
I'm not sure how I
can be conflicted out.

731
00:33:32,891 --> 00:33:34,584
I've shopped at BMI,
but that's about it.

732
00:33:34,609 --> 00:33:35,959
And you, sir?

733
00:33:35,984 --> 00:33:37,148
Do I know you?

734
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:38,318
No, Your Honor.

735
00:33:38,656 --> 00:33:40,028
Nice try, Mr. Boseman,

736
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:42,358
but I reject your motion to recuse me.

737
00:33:42,383 --> 00:33:43,756
We can start with your first witness.

738
00:33:43,781 --> 00:33:45,858
Actually, Your Honor,
there's one more thing.

739
00:33:45,883 --> 00:33:47,252
You're trying my patience, sir.

740
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:50,311
You recently you lost over a
million dollars in an investment.

741
00:33:51,076 --> 00:33:53,448
- Am I correct?
- That's none of your business.

742
00:33:53,473 --> 00:33:55,605
And that loss has nothing
to do with the matter here.

743
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,886
Now sit down.

744
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:59,006
But unfortunately, our
second chair here...

745
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:02,014
uh, Maia, would you stand up
and state your full name please?

746
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,651
Maia Rindell.

747
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:08,988
As you can see, Your Honor,

748
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:11,278
since you've lost most of your savings

749
00:34:11,279 --> 00:34:13,124
to the Rindell Ponzi scheme,

750
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:16,522
you cannot fairly judge this case.

751
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:22,361
So here we all are on this
lovely Wednesday afternoon.

752
00:34:22,386 --> 00:34:24,049
And unfortunately,

753
00:34:24,074 --> 00:34:26,783
I have misplaced my
prescription glasses.

754
00:34:26,808 --> 00:34:30,353
So I will try to make do with
these prescription sunglasses,

755
00:34:30,378 --> 00:34:33,337
if you don't mind me looking
a little bit like a movie star.

756
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,293
Very becoming, Your Honor.

757
00:34:35,318 --> 00:34:36,981
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

758
00:34:37,006 --> 00:34:39,059
Coming from L.A., I'm used to it.

759
00:34:39,084 --> 00:34:40,543
Ah, Los Angeles.

760
00:34:40,568 --> 00:34:41,887
How is your drought?

761
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:43,241
Uh, improving.

762
00:34:43,266 --> 00:34:45,345
Good. I love the way your state

763
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,853
emphasizes green energy.

764
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:49,618
Yes, I have a Tesla myself.

765
00:34:49,643 --> 00:34:51,248
It's such a wonderful car.

766
00:34:51,273 --> 00:34:53,025
Your Honor, the motion to dismiss.

767
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,759
Yes, thank you, Lucca.

768
00:34:56,064 --> 00:34:58,528
The simple fact is the
plaintiff is attempting to use

769
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,048
the theft of 400 running
shoes from my client's...

770
00:35:01,073 --> 00:35:02,662
Not the theft. There is no theft here.

771
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:05,186
If I could finish? Thank you.

772
00:35:05,779 --> 00:35:08,346
To sue 15 respected companies.

773
00:35:08,371 --> 00:35:10,393
In other words, this
is a Trojan Horse...

774
00:35:10,418 --> 00:35:12,627
Actually, the metaphor
I would use, Your Honor,

775
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,441
- is a reverse Robin Hood.
- Seriously?

776
00:35:14,466 --> 00:35:15,979
Well, this is getting heated.

777
00:35:16,004 --> 00:35:18,098
My client makes $40,000 a year.

778
00:35:18,123 --> 00:35:20,278
Ms. Stevens' client makes $13 billion.

779
00:35:20,342 --> 00:35:23,301
And yet every payday, they
take 40% of his take home pay.

780
00:35:23,326 --> 00:35:26,535
Okay, well, battle lines drawn.

781
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,785
Ms. Stevens, your, your first witness.

782
00:35:28,817 --> 00:35:30,495
We had a lot of theft
from the store-room,

783
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,922
almost $600,000 this year.

784
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:35,236
So I was asked to
question the employees.

785
00:35:35,237 --> 00:35:36,954
And why did you zero
in on the plaintiff?

786
00:35:36,979 --> 00:35:39,562
He showed signs of deception
per the Friedman method.

787
00:35:39,587 --> 00:35:41,086
This is a method utilized by the police

788
00:35:41,087 --> 00:35:42,845
- to question suspects?
- Yes.

789
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,749
And the plaintiff
signed this confession?

790
00:35:45,774 --> 00:35:48,216
Yes. He told us exactly how he...

791
00:35:48,217 --> 00:35:49,640
slipped the crates into his car,

792
00:35:49,665 --> 00:35:51,341
took them down to Maxwell Street Market,

793
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:53,147
and sold them to a vendor for $10,000.

794
00:35:53,172 --> 00:35:54,583
- Thank you, Mr. Diyardian.
- He gave me that information.

795
00:35:54,608 --> 00:35:55,698
- Nothing more here, Your Honor.
- Mike,

796
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,223
could you angle that screen some more?

797
00:35:57,248 --> 00:35:59,287
These sunglasses are polarized.

798
00:35:59,312 --> 00:36:01,562
Yeah, keep coming, keep coming. Ah.

799
00:36:01,587 --> 00:36:03,664
Keep coming, keep coming. Oh, well...

800
00:36:07,008 --> 00:36:08,506
Uh, continue, please.

801
00:36:08,507 --> 00:36:11,516
Uh, just a few questions, Benji.

802
00:36:11,695 --> 00:36:14,467
Why didn't you tell the
police about the theft?

803
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:15,973
Excuse me?

804
00:36:15,998 --> 00:36:18,694
Well, if it were me and
I had $70,000 stolen,

805
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:20,427
I would go to the police.

806
00:36:20,452 --> 00:36:23,411
Well, the company would rather
settle these things internally.

807
00:36:23,436 --> 00:36:25,732
And I'd rather you
call me "Mr. Diyardian."

808
00:36:25,757 --> 00:36:27,836
Oh, my apologies.

809
00:36:27,837 --> 00:36:30,166
And Mr. Gwinn stole this $70,000,

810
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:32,006
according to your interrogation?

811
00:36:32,007 --> 00:36:33,171
My interview.

812
00:36:33,218 --> 00:36:35,312
Right, your interview.

813
00:36:35,457 --> 00:36:38,256
To your mind, Frank
Gwinn is a thief, right?

814
00:36:38,898 --> 00:36:40,336
Well, he stole, yes.

815
00:36:40,361 --> 00:36:42,242
Then why didn't the company fire him?

816
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:45,297
Your Honor, I-I think
it's a little odd that BMI

817
00:36:45,322 --> 00:36:48,191
is being censured for doing
the humanitarian thing.

818
00:36:48,216 --> 00:36:50,837
Oh, I don't think
plaintiff is censuring them.

819
00:36:50,862 --> 00:36:53,972
I think she just finds it odd
that they kept the thief on staff,

820
00:36:53,997 --> 00:36:55,495
as do I.

821
00:36:55,876 --> 00:36:58,456
Well, the company just
wanted an opportunity

822
00:36:58,481 --> 00:37:00,463
to claw back its losses, didn't it?

823
00:37:00,505 --> 00:37:01,932
Right, it did.

824
00:37:01,964 --> 00:37:04,166
So the company wanted
to keep Frank employed

825
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:05,876
so they could take from his paycheck?

826
00:37:05,877 --> 00:37:07,876
- Is that right?
- Well, that's not how I'd put it.

827
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:10,337
How would you put it,
Benji? Please take your time.

828
00:37:12,116 --> 00:37:14,973
You're suggesting bad motives here.

829
00:37:14,998 --> 00:37:16,932
But BMI thinks all its employees

830
00:37:16,957 --> 00:37:19,151
should be allowed to make things right.

831
00:37:19,534 --> 00:37:23,221
And so, even though, Frank,
supposedly stole $70,000,

832
00:37:23,246 --> 00:37:25,432
he was still allowed to work alone

833
00:37:25,457 --> 00:37:27,626
and unsupervised in the backroom?

834
00:37:27,627 --> 00:37:29,546
Objection. Asked and answered.

835
00:37:29,718 --> 00:37:32,628
Uh, actually, no, I'd
like to hear the answer.

836
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:34,835
We trust our employees.

837
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,476
And that's why you questioned
him for seven hours?

838
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:38,022
Objection. Argumentative.

839
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,756
I'll rephrase. How many hours
did you question my client?

840
00:37:40,781 --> 00:37:42,218
I don't know. I didn't keep track.

841
00:37:42,243 --> 00:37:44,032
Well, uh...

842
00:37:44,439 --> 00:37:46,710
uh, it says seven hours here.

843
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,321
Oh, hello, Lucca.

844
00:37:54,322 --> 00:37:56,633
Good to see you're still at it.

845
00:37:56,658 --> 00:37:58,392
And it's um...

846
00:37:58,549 --> 00:38:00,446
Mai... I'm sorry, Mia.

847
00:38:00,471 --> 00:38:02,110
- Maia.
- Maia, thank you.

848
00:38:02,135 --> 00:38:04,173
- Hi. I'm Andrea.
- Hi.

849
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:07,046
I'm so terribly sorry about your family.

850
00:38:07,047 --> 00:38:08,796
Must be hard on you.

851
00:38:09,568 --> 00:38:11,416
- It's manageable.
- Manageable.

852
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:12,646
Good.

853
00:38:12,671 --> 00:38:15,756
Women are taking over
the world, piece by piece.

854
00:38:16,474 --> 00:38:19,284
Um, I'm wondering if you and
I could talk sometime, Lucca.

855
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:20,796
We can talk right now.

856
00:38:20,797 --> 00:38:22,546
Well, I-I just

857
00:38:22,547 --> 00:38:25,934
hate doing it here in
a public place, but...

858
00:38:29,489 --> 00:38:32,216
So, what's the offer?

859
00:38:32,603 --> 00:38:33,916
Offer?

860
00:38:33,917 --> 00:38:37,938
No, I-I just wanted to know
where you got your hair cut.

861
00:38:37,963 --> 00:38:40,767
I just, I love the bangs so much.

862
00:38:41,431 --> 00:38:42,765
A friend of mine.

863
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,181
- She cuts hair out of her apartment.
- Really?

864
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:47,585
- Could you maybe get me her number?
- Sure.

865
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,899
Thank you.

866
00:38:49,007 --> 00:38:50,251
Gosh. Mm.

867
00:38:50,276 --> 00:38:51,975
I love this, by the way.

868
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,250
It would look great on
you. Do you want to buy it?

869
00:38:54,275 --> 00:38:55,821
No.

870
00:38:56,985 --> 00:38:59,642
I'd sooner buy the
smile off the Mona Lisa.

871
00:39:00,886 --> 00:39:02,455
See you tomorrow.

872
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:03,820
Bye, Mia.

873
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:09,615
_

874
00:39:14,281 --> 00:39:15,626
It was just was a scare.

875
00:39:15,627 --> 00:39:17,216
Dr. Trotter found another lump.

876
00:39:17,217 --> 00:39:18,876
But he thinks it's nothing.

877
00:39:18,877 --> 00:39:20,297
Good.

878
00:39:20,322 --> 00:39:21,506
Is that why you called?

879
00:39:21,507 --> 00:39:23,470
Oh, yes, I mean, I was told the cancer

880
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:24,784
had spread to your lymph nodes.

881
00:39:24,785 --> 00:39:27,543
Well, that's the fear.

882
00:39:28,134 --> 00:39:30,441
It's good to see you, Maia.

883
00:39:31,172 --> 00:39:32,691
You look older.

884
00:39:38,828 --> 00:39:40,794
Look at me, Mom.

885
00:39:41,586 --> 00:39:42,955
Why?

886
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,138
I just want to ask you a few questions.

887
00:39:45,598 --> 00:39:48,310
Oh, Maia, I spent the last two
weeks answering more questions

888
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:49,466
than I have in my whole life.

889
00:39:49,491 --> 00:39:50,958
Yes. And I am your daughter.

890
00:39:50,983 --> 00:39:53,114
And I just want to ask you a few more.

891
00:39:54,015 --> 00:39:55,388
Look at me.

892
00:39:56,848 --> 00:39:59,787
Okay, I'm looking at you.

893
00:40:01,837 --> 00:40:03,842
Was there really a cancer scare?

894
00:40:04,506 --> 00:40:06,100
Yes, baby,

895
00:40:06,855 --> 00:40:09,068
there was a cancer scare.

896
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:11,831
And you're not lying to me?

897
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:15,136
I'm your mother.

898
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:19,761
- Is Dad guilty?
- You know he's not.

899
00:40:21,513 --> 00:40:22,994
Are you guilty?

900
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,572
No, Maia, I'm not guilty.

901
00:40:27,937 --> 00:40:30,423
Uncle Jax is guilty.

902
00:40:32,147 --> 00:40:34,320
You just need to trust me, baby.

903
00:40:34,345 --> 00:40:36,005
We're family.

904
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:42,075
I don't know if she's lying or not.

905
00:40:44,107 --> 00:40:46,107
About the cancer?

906
00:40:46,705 --> 00:40:49,278
No, about the fund.

907
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,629
Do you think your dad did it?

908
00:40:53,654 --> 00:40:55,527
I don't know.

909
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:59,262
We were always the boring family.

910
00:41:00,732 --> 00:41:04,018
I mean, all my friends, their...

911
00:41:04,322 --> 00:41:06,260
their parents were divorcing

912
00:41:06,293 --> 00:41:09,080
or having affairs and...

913
00:41:10,723 --> 00:41:14,142
I used to lie about
Mom and Dad fighting,

914
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:16,532
so that I wouldn't seem so weird.

915
00:41:19,649 --> 00:41:21,508
And now...

916
00:41:22,878 --> 00:41:26,063
it's like we're paying for
all those years of happiness.

917
00:41:27,956 --> 00:41:30,070
That's your parents.

918
00:41:30,095 --> 00:41:32,953
Doesn't have to be you.

919
00:41:34,415 --> 00:41:36,900
You can be as happy as you want.

920
00:41:40,696 --> 00:41:42,105
And we're back.

921
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,579
Now, here's the thing, young man.

922
00:41:44,604 --> 00:41:45,603
No, you can all sit down.

923
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,762
I have a question for you.

924
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:48,786
What is supination?

925
00:41:48,811 --> 00:41:50,440
I was buying running shoes yesterday

926
00:41:50,465 --> 00:41:52,777
and they told me my feet supinate?

927
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,121
Yeah, uh, supination

928
00:41:54,146 --> 00:41:56,363
is when your feet roll
outward when you run.

929
00:41:56,387 --> 00:41:58,386
- Oh, and that's a bad thing?
- Yes, it can be a bad thing.

930
00:41:58,387 --> 00:42:00,176
But that's why you need shoes
with a firmer outer sole.

931
00:42:00,177 --> 00:42:02,766
- Ah. Shoes like these?
- Uh,

932
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:04,117
Your Honor, um,

933
00:42:04,142 --> 00:42:05,352
we do have a witness,

934
00:42:05,377 --> 00:42:07,172
but if you're feeling
biased towards the plaintiff,

935
00:42:07,197 --> 00:42:08,635
we ask that we be heard on a recusal.

936
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,949
No, no. No, counselor.

937
00:42:09,974 --> 00:42:11,554
I'm just getting some advice.

938
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:12,716
My apologies.

939
00:42:12,717 --> 00:42:14,716
I will work hard toward
neither supinating

940
00:42:14,717 --> 00:42:17,556
nor pronating toward
one side or the other.

941
00:42:17,557 --> 00:42:18,918
Your next witness.

942
00:42:18,943 --> 00:42:21,006
The interviewer merely
tries to ease the way

943
00:42:21,007 --> 00:42:24,198
for a liar to admit
the truth, that's all.

944
00:42:24,223 --> 00:42:26,129
So you tend to minimize the crime?

945
00:42:26,154 --> 00:42:27,331
Yes.

946
00:42:27,613 --> 00:42:29,346
According to Mr.
Diyardian's own testimony,

947
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:30,506
he made it clear to the suspect

948
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:32,259
that the theft was not a big matter.

949
00:42:32,284 --> 00:42:33,676
They just wanted to solve it.

950
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:36,006
In fact, he could understand
why someone would be tempted.

951
00:42:36,007 --> 00:42:37,426
He was even tempted.

952
00:42:37,427 --> 00:42:38,676
And the plaintiff has suggested

953
00:42:38,677 --> 00:42:40,806
that Mr. Diyardian
handed all the details

954
00:42:40,807 --> 00:42:43,096
of the flea market sale to Mr. Gwinn?

955
00:42:43,097 --> 00:42:45,914
Yes, but that's just part of our method.

956
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:47,352
Making it clear to the suspect

957
00:42:47,377 --> 00:42:49,258
that you know all the
particulars of his crime

958
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,096
helps him feel there is
no way to avoid detection.

959
00:42:52,097 --> 00:42:54,346
And this is the same
method used by police

960
00:42:54,347 --> 00:42:56,867
- to catch criminals?
- Yes, definitely.

961
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,367
It is tried and tested.

962
00:42:58,392 --> 00:43:00,195
All done here, Your Honor.

963
00:43:00,507 --> 00:43:02,640
Do you want to do it?

964
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,017
- Well, if you don't want to.
- No. No.

965
00:43:10,042 --> 00:43:11,642
I want to.

966
00:43:28,324 --> 00:43:30,510
Mr. Le Frenais.

967
00:43:30,535 --> 00:43:32,260
La Frenais.

968
00:43:32,285 --> 00:43:34,120
La Frenais.

969
00:43:35,677 --> 00:43:39,166
Is it part of your method

970
00:43:39,191 --> 00:43:42,430
that you can lie to the suspect?

971
00:43:42,455 --> 00:43:45,197
Sorry, Counselor. You,
uh... can you speak up?

972
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:47,947
I think that Lisa is
having problems hearing you.

973
00:43:47,972 --> 00:43:50,011
Yes. Of course.

974
00:43:50,036 --> 00:43:53,445
Is it part of your Friedman method, sir,

975
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:57,072
that you can lie to the
suspect being questioned?

976
00:43:57,097 --> 00:43:59,101
Whoa. Much better, thank you.

977
00:43:59,126 --> 00:44:00,726
It's not part of my method.

978
00:44:00,751 --> 00:44:03,660
It's part of the Supreme Court
decision, Frazier v. Cupp.

979
00:44:03,685 --> 00:44:06,278
Police officers can lie to suspects.

980
00:44:07,238 --> 00:44:10,528
And so in step number
five of your method,

981
00:44:10,553 --> 00:44:12,919
the interviewer is to present

982
00:44:12,944 --> 00:44:15,810
evidence of culpability to the suspect,

983
00:44:15,835 --> 00:44:17,726
whether it's true or not?

984
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:20,367
Well, it's better if the
evidence is true, of course.

985
00:44:21,688 --> 00:44:23,983
But it doesn't have to be?

986
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,851
No.

987
00:44:26,575 --> 00:44:28,630
So when Benji presented Frank

988
00:44:28,655 --> 00:44:30,724
with a DVD recording of him stealing

989
00:44:30,749 --> 00:44:34,083
the $70,000 in running shoes...

990
00:44:34,108 --> 00:44:38,052
a DVD that was completely
blank, by the way...

991
00:44:38,077 --> 00:44:40,739
that was A-okay with you?

992
00:44:40,764 --> 00:44:42,186
Yes,

993
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:45,038
if it helps find a crook, yes.

994
00:44:45,122 --> 00:44:48,676
But doesn't your method
result in false confessions?

995
00:44:48,701 --> 00:44:49,910
Very few.

996
00:44:49,935 --> 00:44:52,215
In fact, hasn't your method

997
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,846
been banned by police

998
00:44:53,871 --> 00:44:56,113
in Canada and England?

999
00:44:56,138 --> 00:44:59,174
I wouldn't call it banned.
They've chosen not to use it.

1000
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:01,442
Oh, because it resulted in
too many false confessions?

1001
00:45:01,467 --> 00:45:02,817
I don't think that's fair.

1002
00:45:02,842 --> 00:45:05,012
But is it true, sir?

1003
00:45:07,439 --> 00:45:09,853
I'll leave that analysis to others.

1004
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:11,340
Analysis. What...

1005
00:45:11,365 --> 00:45:12,637
"The Friedman Method

1006
00:45:12,662 --> 00:45:15,480
"is a banned coercive
technique of interrogation

1007
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:18,762
"that results in too
many false confessions.

1008
00:45:18,787 --> 00:45:22,672
"It is therefore banned
within our jurisdiction."

1009
00:45:23,122 --> 00:45:25,483
Do you mean analysis like that?

1010
00:45:25,508 --> 00:45:26,912
Who wrote that?

1011
00:45:26,937 --> 00:45:28,195
Melissa Starr.

1012
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,862
London Metropolitan
Police. Scotland Yard.

1013
00:45:30,887 --> 00:45:32,084
Okay.

1014
00:45:32,109 --> 00:45:33,444
Uh...

1015
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,303
anything further?

1016
00:45:35,335 --> 00:45:36,924
Nothing here, Your Honor.

1017
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:39,115
Thank you.

1018
00:45:58,866 --> 00:46:00,512
Hi. This is Diane Lockhart's office,

1019
00:46:00,537 --> 00:46:02,996
and I'm her assistant,
Marissa. How may I help you?

1020
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:06,323
It's Dr. Ainsworth at Harbor Hospital.

1021
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:08,675
- Do you want to call him back?
- Please.

1022
00:46:08,762 --> 00:46:10,410
Diane.

1023
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:12,455
You didn't like any of the applicants?

1024
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,191
Oh, for the assistant's job?

1025
00:46:14,216 --> 00:46:16,532
Uh, no, I did. It's
just that I know Marissa,

1026
00:46:16,557 --> 00:46:18,636
and she's on the ball. She's good.

1027
00:46:18,661 --> 00:46:20,016
You'll see.

1028
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:27,201
Okay. This is our offer.

1029
00:46:27,482 --> 00:46:29,306
$500,000 to Frank Gwinn.

1030
00:46:29,307 --> 00:46:30,514
No class action.

1031
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:32,214
If the firm pursues a class action,

1032
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:34,818
our offer goes away
and Frank gets nothing.

1033
00:46:35,503 --> 00:46:38,149
Lot of money for a guy
pulling in 40 grand a year.

1034
00:46:38,275 --> 00:46:39,751
Mm-hmm.

1035
00:46:41,983 --> 00:46:44,403
What do you think of that, Maia?

1036
00:46:47,812 --> 00:46:51,265
I think we'll have to get back to you.

1037
00:46:51,597 --> 00:46:52,976
Okay.

1038
00:46:53,001 --> 00:46:55,080
In the next, uh, two hours,

1039
00:46:55,105 --> 00:46:58,125
or we go back to court, and destroy you.

1040
00:47:00,427 --> 00:47:02,259
- Ms. Stevens.
- Yeah.

1041
00:47:02,284 --> 00:47:03,868
I have an answer for you now.

1042
00:47:03,893 --> 00:47:05,868
Oh. Great.

1043
00:47:06,387 --> 00:47:08,267
My hair stylist's number.

1044
00:47:16,411 --> 00:47:17,808
Well?

1045
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:21,385
We got a decision to make.

1046
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:23,791
No. It's not enough
money for us to take.

1047
00:47:23,816 --> 00:47:25,853
It's not your decision.
It's the client's.

1048
00:47:25,878 --> 00:47:27,736
No. It's a decision for the whole class:

1049
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,252
all 24 clients.

1050
00:47:29,277 --> 00:47:31,072
The algorithm says we stay in.

1051
00:47:31,097 --> 00:47:32,168
This is crazy.

1052
00:47:32,193 --> 00:47:34,566
You can't have them decide what we do.

1053
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:36,027
They're paying the bills, Lucca.

1054
00:47:36,052 --> 00:47:37,601
Yes, but Frank needs the money.

1055
00:47:37,626 --> 00:47:40,137
If we pass on this,
he could get nothing.

1056
00:47:40,162 --> 00:47:41,701
Or he could get a whole lot more.

1057
00:47:41,834 --> 00:47:44,084
Let's just wait and see.

1058
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:51,302
I just have one last
question for you, Frank.

1059
00:47:51,378 --> 00:47:53,092
Why did you confess?

1060
00:47:53,138 --> 00:47:57,177
If you didn't do it, then
why would you confess?

1061
00:47:57,202 --> 00:47:59,444
He made it seem like
it was the only way out.

1062
00:47:59,469 --> 00:48:01,008
He he had a DVD of me doing it.

1063
00:48:01,033 --> 00:48:03,275
And if you knew there
was nothing on that DVD,

1064
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,462
then why would you confess?

1065
00:48:05,947 --> 00:48:08,267
I felt helpless. I was exhausted.

1066
00:48:08,292 --> 00:48:11,353
He had me convinced that I
just repressed the memory.

1067
00:48:11,378 --> 00:48:12,814
He said he had a witness who swore

1068
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:14,930
that I was down at a flea
market, selling the shoes.

1069
00:48:14,955 --> 00:48:16,509
- Were you?
- No.

1070
00:48:16,534 --> 00:48:18,163
But he said he was gonna
give all this to the cops

1071
00:48:18,188 --> 00:48:19,531
if I didn't come clean to the company.

1072
00:48:19,556 --> 00:48:21,095
Come clean, meaning?

1073
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,688
Sign this statement that he wrote up.

1074
00:48:22,713 --> 00:48:23,930
- And so you signed it?
- Yes.

1075
00:48:23,955 --> 00:48:25,399
He said that I could keep my job,

1076
00:48:25,424 --> 00:48:27,543
he said that the
questioning would be over.

1077
00:48:27,568 --> 00:48:29,987
He said that I would still
be on management track.

1078
00:48:30,012 --> 00:48:32,051
Did you know that Benji gets a bonus

1079
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,964
for every employee he gets to confess?

1080
00:48:33,989 --> 00:48:36,028
Objection. No foundation.

1081
00:48:36,053 --> 00:48:38,012
Uh, that is definitely sustained.

1082
00:48:38,037 --> 00:48:39,987
Okay, um, I think

1083
00:48:40,012 --> 00:48:41,698
I'm ready to rule on this motion.

1084
00:48:41,768 --> 00:48:43,989
Uh, Your Honor, I'd
like to cross-examine.

1085
00:48:44,014 --> 00:48:45,481
This is not a full trial.

1086
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,085
This is merely a motion to dismiss.

1087
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:49,426
Yeah, I know, but this information
just came into our hands.

1088
00:48:49,451 --> 00:48:51,847
We were hoping to use
it at trial, but...

1089
00:48:51,872 --> 00:48:54,005
we think we can save the
court a lot of time and money

1090
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:56,506
if we could ask it now.

1091
00:48:56,864 --> 00:49:00,028
- I... am enticed.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1092
00:49:01,525 --> 00:49:04,684
Mr. Gwinn, where did
you work before BMI?

1093
00:49:04,709 --> 00:49:06,301
Various places. I worked as a temp.

1094
00:49:06,326 --> 00:49:08,786
And was one these places
Tolleson Accounting?

1095
00:49:08,811 --> 00:49:11,059
- Yes.
- You had a clerical job there?

1096
00:49:11,084 --> 00:49:12,673
Uh-huh.

1097
00:49:12,698 --> 00:49:14,208
Uh-huh...

1098
00:49:14,233 --> 00:49:16,091
I'll take that as a yes.

1099
00:49:16,116 --> 00:49:18,455
And were you asked to leave?

1100
00:49:18,807 --> 00:49:20,714
- I didn't do it.
- Yeah.

1101
00:49:20,739 --> 00:49:22,597
I think you know what's coming, Frank.

1102
00:49:22,622 --> 00:49:24,685
There was a petty cash situation,

1103
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:26,800
several hundred dollars?

1104
00:49:27,433 --> 00:49:29,262
And were you accused of taking it?

1105
00:49:29,287 --> 00:49:30,496
I told them I didn't take it.

1106
00:49:30,521 --> 00:49:31,715
But you agreed to leave

1107
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:32,935
if they didn't call the cops?

1108
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,872
Objection, there is no record of this.

1109
00:49:34,897 --> 00:49:37,419
Our investigators
questioned this business.

1110
00:49:37,444 --> 00:49:40,044
Yes, because the manager at the time

1111
00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:41,732
talked only to our investigator,

1112
00:49:41,757 --> 00:49:44,159
and signed this affidavit.

1113
00:49:44,184 --> 00:49:45,339
I didn't do it.

1114
00:49:45,364 --> 00:49:47,143
In it, he swears that
Frank took the money,

1115
00:49:47,168 --> 00:49:49,314
then when he was caught,
promised to return it

1116
00:49:49,339 --> 00:49:50,993
if they kept the theft secret.

1117
00:49:51,018 --> 00:49:52,065
That's a lie!

1118
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,759
That's a complete and total lie.

1119
00:49:54,317 --> 00:49:56,037
Okay. That is information

1120
00:49:56,062 --> 00:49:57,833
I will take into consideration.

1121
00:49:57,858 --> 00:49:59,572
Does the defendant
have any more questions?

1122
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:00,701
Nothing more, Your Honor.

1123
00:50:00,726 --> 00:50:02,701
Unless the plaintiff has anything more,

1124
00:50:02,726 --> 00:50:04,732
I will rule on this motion.

1125
00:50:09,717 --> 00:50:11,709
I hate losing.

1126
00:50:13,387 --> 00:50:14,945
It was a good effort.

1127
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,609
Does this impact the class?

1128
00:50:17,634 --> 00:50:20,219
Yes, unfortunately.

1129
00:50:20,244 --> 00:50:23,133
The litigation financiers dropped out.

1130
00:50:23,534 --> 00:50:25,443
I thought he was telling the truth.

1131
00:50:25,468 --> 00:50:26,727
Well, maybe he was.

1132
00:50:26,752 --> 00:50:28,346
About the running shoes.

1133
00:50:28,371 --> 00:50:32,057
You know, people can lie and
still be telling the truth.

1134
00:50:32,091 --> 00:50:35,190
Nobody's a hundred
percent of any one thing.

1135
00:50:38,075 --> 00:50:40,695
My mom lied about her cancer.

1136
00:50:42,612 --> 00:50:45,384
It was a scare. It wasn't real.

1137
00:50:45,853 --> 00:50:48,151
She just wanted to see me.

1138
00:50:52,035 --> 00:50:54,179
She's lonely.

1139
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:58,078
People get desperate
when they're lonely.

1140
00:50:58,809 --> 00:51:01,099
You should go see her.

1141
00:51:07,035 --> 00:51:08,726
Mom?

1142
00:51:14,183 --> 00:51:15,835
Mom?

1143
00:51:19,682 --> 00:51:21,749
Maia, what are you doing?

1144
00:51:21,774 --> 00:51:23,563
I wanted to see how you were.

1145
00:51:23,588 --> 00:51:26,155
Good. I was just going to bed.

1146
00:51:27,536 --> 00:51:29,108
What's wrong?

1147
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:32,575
Why don't we have breakfast tomorrow?

1148
00:51:33,892 --> 00:51:36,161
Whose car is that outside?

1149
00:51:36,186 --> 00:51:38,747
Just the painters were here
yesterday. They left one.

1150
00:51:38,772 --> 00:51:40,822
Where's the tea, Lenore?

1151
00:51:45,407 --> 00:51:47,590
It's not a good time.

1152
00:51:49,616 --> 00:51:51,076
Hi, Uncle Jax.

1153
00:51:51,786 --> 00:51:56,403
