You're a genius.

131
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,220
总能发现备用品在哪里
Always know where the reserves are.

132
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,860
放下你的过去
Let go of your past.

133
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,020
-说到点子上了 -现在是时候放下了
- Bit on the nose. - Now is the time to let it go.

134
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,810
开放你的感官 闭上嘴 享受现在
Open up your senses, close your mouth and live now.

135
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:00,820
欢迎来到只对女性开放的寂静之息冥想活动
Welcome to the female-only Breath Of Silence retreat.

136
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,540
女性们应该沉默
Women don't speak.

137
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,380
呃 对不起 我觉得我应该在
Erm, sorry. I think I'm meant to be at...

138
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,480
-“可恨的荡妇” -那个活动
- 'Fucking sluts!' - ...that one.

139
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,020
可惜了
Shame.

140
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:19,630
是的 现在最重要的问题是你们为什么在这里
Yes, the first major consideration is why are you here?

141
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,620
现场谁能回答这个问题
Can anyone here answer that question?

142
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,540
我想隔绝外面的噪音 重新回到我的内心
I want to shut the noise out and reconnect to my inner thoughts

143
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,180
去获取更多关于自身的感觉
on the road to feeling more at one with myself.

144
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,580
不错的态度
Excellent attitude.

145
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,220
那么 你来对了地方
Well, you're in the right place.

146
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,700
这个周末有关于专注内心
And this weekend is about being mindful.

147
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,300
关于将你的声音留在头脑里
It's about leaving your voice in your head...

148
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,860
将你的想法困在头颅中
...and trapping your thoughts in your skull.

149
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,730
想象你的大脑中有一个思维监狱
Think of it as a thought prison in your mind.

150
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,710
首先 我们将会教你如何呼吸
Firstly, we're going to teach you how to breathe.

151
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,620
接着我们会有一次短暂的冥想
Then we will have a short meditation,

152
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,340
然后我们会在参加枯燥任务的过程中寻找到我们心灵的庇护所
then we will find our sanctuary in the partaking of menial tasks,

153
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,310
这一切都在绝对的寂静中
all in perfect silence.

154
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,900
原则性的规定就是不要讲话
Principal rules are no talking.

155
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,700
如果你想和我们其中一位监管员交流
If you need to communicate with any of our other superiors,

156
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,140
你可以写在那个黑板上
you can write on that board.

157
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,940
在任何你想交流的情况下
Under no other circumstances must you communicate,

158
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,340
甚至是想互相交流的时候
even with each other.

159
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,500
-如果是紧急情况呢 -感谢你们今天到场
- What about an emergency? - Thank you all for coming here today.

160
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,790
不管发生了什么 一点声音都不能发出
No matter what happens, a word must not be heard.

161
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,980
嘘
Shh!

162
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,460
“荡妇”
'Slut!'

163
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,060
“荡妇”
'Slut!'

164
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,740
“贱人”
'Bitch!'

165
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,420
“贱人 贱人”
'Bitch, bitch!'

166
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,540
可恨的贱人 你就是一坨屎
Fucking bitch! You fucking piece of shit.

167
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,700
过来 过来 到我这儿来
Back here! Back here, back to me. Back to me.

168
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,540
好的 现在 不管那些怨言是因为什么 是因为你的教养也好
All right, now, wherever it's come from... your upbringing,

169
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:02,140
或是因为你和女人的经历也罢 现在是时候改变一下了
your experiences with women, now is the time to turn that around.

170
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,220
重装你的思想
To reprogram your mind,

171
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,940
你的身体 你的嘴
your body and your mouth.

172
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,500
成为一个更好的男人
To be the better... man.

173
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,860
好吗
All right?

174
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,740
那么 这位是帕特希亚
So, this... is Patricia.

175
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,300
好吗 她是个朋友
Yeah? She's a friend.

176
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,180
现在 帕特希亚刚刚在工作中获得升职
Now, Patricia has just earned a promotion at work,

177
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,740
打败了其他六位候选者
beating over six other candidates.

178
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,270
她是获得这个这个职位最年轻的人
She's the youngest person to ever achieve this role.

179
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,060
我们在遇见她的时候不能说什么
What should we not say when we meet her?

180
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,320
-聪明的小不点 -好极了

我们应当对她说什么呢
What should we say to her?

185
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,900
嗯
Hmm?

186
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,260
-做的不错 帕特希亚 -非常好

“做的不错 帕特希亚”
"Well done, Patricia."

188
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,860
请离开

190
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,300

191
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,940

00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,820
荡妇
Slut!

193
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,940
伙计们 没事
Guys, it's OK.

194
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,260
凯斯 来
Keith, come.

195
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,220
我的天哪 对不起女士 你不能来这里
Oh, my God. Excuse me, miss, you can't be here.

196
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,820
-好的 -你真的不能到这里来
- OK. - You really can't be here.

197
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,580
这会让他们感觉不好的 求你了
It's a feel-no-good. Please.

198
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,340
现在 举起你们的手
And now, hands up.

199
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,550
掌心相对
Mirror your palms.

200
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,540
看着对方的眼睛
Look each other in the eye, and...

201
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,250
然后触碰
...touch.

202
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,040
绝对是她最可怕的噩梦
Literally her worst nightmare.

203
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,100
噁
Eugh!

205
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,980
-和我说说 -没什么
- Talk to me. - It's nothing.

206
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,060
天哪
God.

207
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,580
我感觉不到我的脚了
I can't feel my feet.

208
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,500
你还记得我们曾经玩“从头到脚”吗
Do you remember we used to go top-to-toe?

209
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,600
现在的孩子都很怪
Now kids are so weird.

210
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,120
-我们以前总是玩那个游戏

212
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,580
-现在我们三十岁了 而且愤世嫉俗 -我不是在说我们
- Now we're 30 and angry. - I'm not suggesting that we...

213
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,960
就是别说了 行吗
Just don't, OK?

214
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,960
别偷我的东西了

215
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,740

217
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,760
嘘
'Shh!'

218
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,180

It's actually a really thoughtful present. Thank you.

220
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,580
马丁给我了那个小雕塑
And Martin getting me that sculpture.

221
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,420
他为了买到这个东西肯定花了不少心血
He must have bent over backwards to get something like that.

222
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,100
我觉得自己好幸运
I feel very lucky.

223
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,460
我跟你说啊
I have to tell you something.

224
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,140
什么
What?

225
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:25,260
那个雕像是我从别人的工作室顺手拿的
I stole that sculpture from a certain somebody's studio

226
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,300
然后想通过马丁找个买主
and then I tried to sell it through Martin,

227
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,080
不过马丁把雕像留下了 还送给了你
but Martin took it and gave it to you.

228
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,970
这事你可别当着老爸
Just don't put it pride of place when Dad...

229
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,010
呃 当着他们的面说
well, when they come over.

230

-我们越快适应 -啊

235
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,580
我们越快适应 就能越快离开这里
The sooner we get on with it, the sooner we are out of here.

236
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,970
-这外套真好看 -谢啦
- That's a really nice outfit. - Thanks.

237
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,260
深入挖掘你的回忆
Delve into your past.

238
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,850
想想你无法释怀的东西
Think of something you can't let go of.

239
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,850
一段噪音
A moment of noise.

240
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,980
一个紧张时刻
A moment of tension.

241
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,690
-不要 -现在
- Not for now. - Now...

242
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,210
想想你觉得内心平静的时刻
...A moment when you were peaceful.

243
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,750
要是你能随心所欲
If you could change

244
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,580
改变世上的任何东西 你想改变什么
anything in the whole world, what would it be?

245
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,200
我的大腿
My thighs.

246
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,660
整个世界你就想改变这个
In the whole world?

247
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,780
可别跟别人说 那你呢
Don't tell anyone I said that. You?

248
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,240
我一直对自己的颜值挺不满的
I've always been insecure about my face.

249
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,060
-你明明知道 -我知道
- You know that. - I know.

250
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,700
-你不用不满啊 -谢了 不过
- You shouldn't. - Thank you, but...

251
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,500
不啊 真的 你的鼻子一点问题都没有
No, seriously, there's nothing wrong with your nose.

252
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,110
-我的意思是 你的脸 -你再说一遍
- I mean, there's nothing wrong... - Say that again?

253
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,460
-我的意思是 你的脸 -你说什么
- I mean, there's nothing wrong... - What?

254
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,810
不知道
I don't know.

255
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,070
-啊 -哦天
- Ah! - Oh, my God.

256
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,040
我总说错话
I always say the wrong thing!

257
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,140
啊 啊
Ah! Agh!

258
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,380
好烫
Hot.

259
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,420
这是干嘛 我在自己家都不干这些活的
What is this? I don't even do this in my own home.

260
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,100
道理很简单
Well, it's very simple.

261
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,950
我们是花钱给人家做扫除 还不能出声
We've paid them to let us clean their house in silence.

262
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,100
老天
Jesus.

263
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,460
我不想像老师一样批评你们
I don't want to come down on you like a schoolteacher,

264
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,140
但是你们明目张胆违反这里的规则
but I'm afraid your flagrant lack of respect for the one rule

265
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,500
恐怕已经影响到其他学生了
that we have here is now affecting the other students.

266
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,200
-顾客 -你是说囚犯吗
- Clients. - Inmates?

267
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,220
