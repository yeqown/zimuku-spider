where we have all but destroyed each other.

We designed you city as an experiment.
把你們的城市設計成實驗室

And we believe it is the only way to recover the humanity we have lost.

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,040
And we created Factions to ensure peace.

7
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,360
But we believe there will be those among you

who will transcend these factions,

these will be the Divergent.

10

They are the true purpose of this experiment,

they are vital to humanity survival.

for you to emerge from your isolation and rejoin us.

奉伊芙琳之令 馬上關閉城門

Mankind waits for you with hope, beyond the Wall.
其他人類正在圍牆外滿懷希望地等待著你們

20
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,680

What are you, afraid of heights?

No. Who told you that?

25
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,650
Sometimes when I look past the wall,

No. I don't.
我 看不到

29
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,200

When it's right in front of your face, you will.

You sure we're going to do this?

People of Chicago,

but sometimes walls are there to protect us.

38

記住 正式那些創建者把我們劃分成了若干派系

39
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,080
So, until we know their intentions, the wall must stay closed.

Jeanine is dead.

I need to talk to her.

47
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,750

不 我可不想  去制定什麼規矩

61
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,420
Great leaders don't seek power, they're called by necessity.
偉大的領導者從不追逐權利 他們被社會需求所召喚

62
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,440

I dedicated my life to seeking the truth, but under Jeanine, it passed me by.
我畢生的志願就是追尋真相  但珍寧卻讓我錯過了它

70
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,430
And for that, I humbly apologize.
為此 我真誠想諸位道歉

71
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:30,830
But my personal failure has only strengthened my resolve to make things right.
但是我失敗的教訓 更堅定了我糾正自己錯誤的決心

00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,570
While the Faction of Candor may no longer exist,
即使現在誠實派不復存在了

00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,560
Let the trials begin! Justice will be done!

May the truth set you free.
願真相讓你解脫

There's no doubt, Max, that you helped Jeanine take over Chicago,
毫無疑問 你協助珍寧接管了芝加哥

and exert brutal control over it's citizens.

So, my only question to you is this.

Did you feel justified in murdering people in support of her regime?

84
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,740
Absolutely.

85
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,990
People are sheep. They need a shepherd to guide them.

86
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,720

You can't do this, stop it!

And I yield, to the wishes of the people.

00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:58,260
There was a time I would have said: I leave you with love, not malice.
過去我說過  我願你們活在愛裡 而不是恨裡

if you were just going to become her?

那也不能待在這兒解決所有衝突

資訊裡也說要走出去面對新世界

00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,130
Yet, we know absolutely nothing about the people who sent it.

Please place your arm into the tube in the wall.
請把手放進牆上的孔道裡

279
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,290
There's nothing to worry about, Tris.

Please place your arm into the tube.
請把手放進孔道裡

281
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,160
I've never felt so clean in my life.
這輩子都沒這麼乾淨過

282
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,980
That was the best weird shower I've ever had.
這是我洗過的最奇怪的澡了

283

Why they are all different?
為什麼都不一樣

286
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:13,260
Hello, and welcome to the Bureau of Genetic Welfare.
你們好 歡迎各位光臨基因福利局

287
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,520
In the early part of the 21st century, scientists first discovered a way to map
在21世紀上半時 科學家們首次發現並繪製了

288
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:21,660
then edit the human genome.
改變人類基因組的方法 你可以選擇健康

289
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:27,550
You can choose to settle from "merely adequate" or you can choose "excellent".
你能選擇保持自身的基因組 也能選擇改善它們

290
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,000
A genetic solution puts you in control of your life.
基因解決方案讓你可以掌控自己的生命

291
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:36,070
So, why just hope for a better future, when you can choose perfection?
為什麼不期待一個更美好的未來 當你有機會選擇完美時

292
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,350
Choose Perfexia.
請選擇蒲飛霞

293
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:41,670
But, what started as an attempt to erase humanity's fault,
但是正如試圖清楚人類缺陷一樣

294
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,250
almost erased humanity itself.
人性也幾乎被抹殺了

295
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,360
Genetic modification deepened the rifts between people.
基因改造加劇了人們之間的分歧

296
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:50,620
And as they got more entrenched, the world began to tear apart,
當矛盾越來越深 世界便開始四分五裂

297
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:55,730
until humanity cross a line, from which it could never return.
人類也因無法恢復原始基因而變得無可挽救

298
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,600
In the ashes of civilization,
在這片文明的廢墟上

299
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:05,810
a small group of genetically unmodified individuals established the "BUREAU OF GENETIC WELFARE."
一小群基因未被改造的人建立了你們今天所在的這個基因福利局 “基因福利局”

300
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,120
here in Chicago's O'Hare Airport.
在這兒 芝加哥的奧黑爾機場

301
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,260
Our mission is to oversee a grand experiment
我們的任務是監控一項重要的實驗

302
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,570
to purify the human genome.
其目的就是淨化人類的基因組

303
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,260
That experiment is the city of Chicago.
而實驗室就是芝加哥市

304
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:24,000
Your participation in the Bureau's work means you are now the guardians of the future.
你們參與到了基因局的工作 就意味著成為了人類未來的守護者

機場是什麼鬼

308
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,330
Life in the Bureau can be demanding.
在這兒生活限制很多

309
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,890
The work is worth every sacrifice.
但是我們的值得為此付出

310
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,870
We don't have all the resources we would like of course,
基因局並不是要什麼就有什麼

311
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,880
but I think you'll find your accommodations more than adequate
但足以滿足你們的基本生活

312
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:58,970
- Whoa. - Wow.

315
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:05,540
Get them healthy. Give them a second chance.
等他們治好了 就能活下去了

316
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,370
- Hi, Four. - Hi, Four.

317
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,080
Hi, Four.
老四

319
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,640
The experiment is the entire focus of the Bureau.
實驗室是整個基因局的焦點

320
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:18,900
Our Surveillance Technology is centuries ahead of anything you know in Chicago.
我們的監控技術領先你們芝加哥幾個世紀

321
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,560
They grown up watching you.

322
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,930
Nothing creepy about that.
你可嚇著我們了

323
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,000
You have to forgive everyone for staring, but...

378
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,930
but I don't want your to worry about that.
但我不想你為這些擔心

and put them in a safe place like Chicago,
放在像芝加哥這樣安全的城市裡

391
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:33,070
then perhaps over time, man's genetic material would heal itself.

That doesn't- That doesn't make any sense
你這麼說沒道理 我是說

396
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,490
Four is divergent. There's lot of divergences.
老四也是分歧者 還有很多分歧者

397
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,340
Not divergent, Tris. Pure.
不是分歧者  翠絲  是純淨者

398
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:52,090
You're genetically "pure". The rest are still "damaged".

不像凱萊布那麼嚴重  但也是缺陷者

401
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,630
If we can understand what made you,

402
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,910
maybe we can use that knowledge to help the "damaged".

I'm going to bring you with me to Providence to meet them.
我準備帶你去見他們

408

00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:52,450
The factions kept Chicago peaceful for a long time.
派系在很長時間裡維持了芝加哥的和平

543
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:55,650
Well, I wouldn't know about that because I was forced out of my faction.
我並不瞭解這個，因為我被迫離開了派系

544
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:58,390
I gave up my life, my child, everything.
我放棄了我的生活，我的孩子，所有

545
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,580
I understand your anger, Evelyn, I do.
我理解你的憤怒 伊芙琳 真的

546
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:05,670
- But the way forward... - The way forward has already began.
但是未來的路 -未來的路已經鋪好了

547
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:11,240
I know I said I'd be alone, but...
我說過我會一個人來

548
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:13,860
I'm not Candor and I'm not Amity.
但我不是誠實派也不是友好派

549
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:17,620
So I will lie and I will fight if I have to.
所以我撒了謊 如果有必要的話我還會戰鬥

550
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:21,850
You see these scars? I wasn't born Amity.
看見這些傷疤了嗎？我不是出生在友好派

551
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:27,040
And I can assure you I'm not afraid to fight for what I believe in.
我能向你保證 我並不害怕為信念而戰

552
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,950
It seems like we're 2 peas in a pot.
看來我們是同一類人

553
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:33,860
But it doesn't have to be this way.
但並不一定非要這種方式

554
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:36,610
We can come to some sort of agreement.
我們可以好好商量

555
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:41,020
- Get back! - Get down!
退後 ！-趴下

556
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,530
- Get out of here! - Let's go.
離開這 -我們走

557
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,190
- Go! - Go.
快-快

558
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:56,080
Alright, Caleb.
聽著 凱萊布

559
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:58,860
Keep me posted if anything changes, alright?
萬一情況有變通知我好嗎？

560
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,080
- Hi. - Hey.
你好-你也是

561
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,940
Caleb said that some of the Dauntless are lining with Johanna.
凱萊布說無畏派的一些人站到了約翰娜這邊

562
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,870
But the rest of Candor are still solid with Evelyn.
但剩下的誠實派還和伊芙琳一個陣營

563
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:16,550
Things are  finally out of control.
局勢就快失去控制了

564
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,530
Did David say anything about what he can do?
大衛說過他能做什麼嗎？

565
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:22,810
Yeah, once we talk to the Council, then the Bureau can step in.
我們跟委員會談完 基因局會介入

566
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:28,270
So, it all hinges on the mysterious Council, does it?
所以這全靠神秘的委員會了 對吧？

567
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:31,950
- What if they say no? - David is confident that they won't.
他們不同意怎麼辦？ -大衛有信心說服他們

568
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,660
David, right.
大衛，好吧

569
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:40,390
You know, I found out why I can't go upstairs.
你知道，我搞清楚自己為什麼不能上去了

570
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:45,150
I'm "damaged", and you're "pure".
我是缺陷者 你是純淨者

571
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,280
I know.
我知道

572
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:51,920
You know. When were you going to tell me?
你知道 你打算什麼時候告訴我？

573
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,670
I don't know. I...
我不知道 我……

574
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,670
- I guess I didn't think that it matter. - Why doesn't it matter?
但我覺得這並不重要-為什麼不重要？

575
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:02,290
Because it doesn't make a difference if you're "pure" or  you're "damaged".
因為不管是純淨者還是缺陷者都沒什麼區別

576
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:06,510
You're still the same person to me.
對我來說你就是你

577
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:15,660
Look. I know that it's not perfect, by any means, but...
聽著 我知道無論如何它都不完美

578
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,300
The Bureau saved my mother from the Fringe. I wouldn't be here without her.
但基因局從邊界地帶救出了我媽媽，沒有他們我也不會再這兒

579
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:21,220
What do you actually know about what they do in the Fringe?
我們真的瞭解他們在哪兒做過什麼嗎？

580
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:23,770
You know what they tell you.
你只是聽他們說的

581
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:25,480
- Yeah, but... - I'm sorry.
是的 但是 -打擾下

582
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,470
He needs you upstairs.

583
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,180
He needs you upstairs.
他請你去樓上

584
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:55,810
Those people are nice, weird, but nice.
那些人恨友好，雖然奇怪 但很友好

585
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,230
Yeah. They're definitely weird, that's for sure.
是啊 他們的確很奇怪

586
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,410
You better get used to it.
你已經習慣了

587
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:02,350
- Really? - Yeah.
是嗎？ -沒錯

588
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:05,040
Next time you go to the Fringe, I want in.
下次去邊界地帶帶上我，我想加入

589
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,700

00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:18,050
I'm more than aware that the separation
我注意到分離對於你和老四來說很困難

593
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:20,620
has been difficult for you and Four, but...

594
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,070
I've watched you both enough to know that
但我已經觀察你們很久了

595
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:26,250
I think the two of you are going to work it out.
我想你們該解決下彼此之間的矛盾

We're fine.

Good. Let's get to work.

外面的人平均能活多久？  -25到30歲

如果小時候就被救了，在基因局能活到50-60歲

610

無畏派 如果是我就不會讓你們來這兒

You said that you couldn't do anything.
你跟我說過你無能為力

克莉絲蒂娜，這是給你和翠斯的 -你怎麼知道我們要走？
